For the Pumps project:

Please look at the things in such order:

1- Bike_Pred_RF.py
2- Bikes_RandomForest.ipynb - which consists .py file to see it as a story.

Bike_Pred_RF.py performs feature engineering, uses RF as fitter, hyperparam.
optimization, CV and plots feature importance, assumption check plots and ytrain
vs ypred.
It also gives an output of final desired csv that has predicted outcome, real
counts and datetime column of timestamps.


To run the .py program:

1- Run Terminal
2- Prompt "python[version of your own, if any] Bike_Pred_RF [filname]"
