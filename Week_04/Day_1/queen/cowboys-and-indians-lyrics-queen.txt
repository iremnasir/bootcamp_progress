["It's a long fast dance\nWell the long fast dance of progress\nAnd the long slow waltz of decay\nMade such a natural born couple\nThey settled down right here in the USA\nDream home for two in the USA\nHot jazz, cool blues, we got country\nWe get rock and roll all day\nLike to dance, come on down get funky\nThat's the way, that's the way\nThat's the way hey, hey in the USA\nThere's still cowboys and indians at home on the range\nBut the cowboys and indians have changed - they've changed\nWe've got James Dean on the silver screen\nWe've got James Brown he won't let you down\nNow Elvis was the king of rock and roll\nWe got preacher men who want to save your soul\nGot the motorcity with the Motown beat\nGet hip to the beat on the hip hop street\nStars and bars and the biggest cars\nAnd a rocket ship take you up to Mars\nThere's the east coast trip where it's real uptight\nWhere you work all day and you play all night\nAnd the west coast side with the laid back scene\nWhen you just lay back and it seems like a dream\nThere's a lot of places in between\nThere's Hollywood and the city by the bay\nAnd the whole damn south down Louisiana way, way, way\nThat's the way, that's the way hey, hey in the USA\nThere's still cowboys and indians at home on the range\nBut the cowboys and indians have changed, the've changed\nIn the land of the free and the home of the brave\nThe cowboys and cowgirls and indians have changed\nBaby, baby, baby\nThat's the way, that's the way in the USA\nCowboys and indians...\nHome on the range..."]
