["(Freddie)\nWhen all the salt is taken from the sea\nI stand dethroned\nI'm naked and i plea\nThe way your finger points so solidly\nIs anybody there to believe in me\nTo hear my plea\nAnd take care of me", "(chorus)\nHow can i go on\nFrom day to day\nWho can make me strong\nIn every way\nWhere can i be safe\nWhere can i belong\nIn this great big world\nOf sadness\nHow can i forget\nThose beautiful dreams that we shared\nThey're lost and they're nowhere to be found\nHow can i go on", "(Monserrat)\nSometimes i start to crawl\nBut in my eyes\nI cannot see", "When people fly by me\nI hide myself down near the ground\nIs anybody there\nTo look for me", "(Freddie)\nLa-da-da-da-da precious love\nhear my plea-yeah!", "(chorus)\nHow can i go on\nFrom day to day\nWho can make me strong\nIn every way\nWhere can i be safe\nWhere can i belong\nIn this great big world\nOf sadness\nHow can i forget\nThose beautiful dreams that we shared"]
