["Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed.\nTake a look at all the suffering we breed.\nSo many lonely faces scattered all around", "Searching for what they need.", "Is this the world we created?\nWhat did we do it for?\nIs this the world we invaded against the law?\nSo it seems in the end\nIs this what we're all living for today?\nThe world that we created", "You know that every day a helpless child is born", "Who needs some loving care inside a happy home\nSomewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne", "Waiting for life to go by\nIs this the world we created?", "We made it on our own\nIs this the world we devastated right to the bone?\nIf there's a God in the sky, looking down,\nWhat can he think of what we've done\nTo the world that He created?"]
