["What do you do? I said what do you do?\nYou ain't wearin' a tie, you ain't got a jacket\nYou can't come in 'cos you're in the wrong bracket\nYou can shove it\nVIP's and royalty get treated like they're special see\nBut the trick is there for all to see\nThey're people just like you and me\nYou can shove it\nGirls - we love it\nCars - we love it\nMore girls - we love it\nLate night bars - we love it\nPool - we love it\nSchool - fantasy\nWhat do you do?\nYou can shove it\nYou gotta talk, act and dress right\nIf you ain't got money, they treat ya funny\nWhen they say the class system's dead\nIf you think that's true better get a new head\nYou can shove it\nYou can shove it\nYou can shove it\nGirls - we love it\nCars - we love it\nMore girls - we love it\nAnd late night bars - we love it\nPool - we love it\nSchool - shove it\nWhat do you do?\nShove it,\nYou can shove it.\nSo why do people scrape and fuss\nWhen everyman's the same as us\nIt's a joke on all humanity\nIt's privilege\nAnd we don't need it\nWar - shove it\nHate - shove it\nPoliticians - don't cut it\nBlind dates - shove it\nGirls schools - we love it\nCrazy rules - shove it\nWhat do you do?\nYou can shove it\nYou can shove it...etc"]
