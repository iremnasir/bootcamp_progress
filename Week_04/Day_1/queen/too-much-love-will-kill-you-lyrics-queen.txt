["I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be\nToo many bitter tears are raining down on me\nI'm far away from home\nAnd I've been facing this alone for much too long\nOh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me\nAbout growing up and what a struggle it would be\nIn my tangled state of mind\nI've been looking back to find where I went wrong\nToo much love will kill you\nIf you can't make up your mind", "Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind\nYou're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs\nToo much love will kill you every time\nI'm just the shadow of the man I used to be\nAnd it seems like there's no way out of this for me\nI used to bring you sunshine", "Now all I ever do is bring you down, oooh\nHow would it be if you were standing in my shoes\nCan't you see that it's impossible to choose\nNo there's no making sense of it\nEvery way I go I'm bound to lose, oh yeah\nToo much love will kill you\nJust as sure as none at all\nIt'll drain the power that's in you", "Make you plead and scream and crawl\nAnd the pain will make you crazy\nYou're the victim of your crime\nToo much love will kill you every time\nYeah too much love will kill you\nIt'll make your life a lie\nYes too much love will kill you", "And you won't understand why\nYou'd give your life you'd sell your soul\nBut here it comes again\nToo much love will kill you\nIn the end.\nIn the end."]
