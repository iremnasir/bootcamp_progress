["In my defence what is there to say\nAll the mistakes we made must be faced today\nIt's not easy now knowing where to start\nWhile the world we love tears itself apart\nI'm just a singer with a song\nHow can I try to right the wrong\nFor just a singer with a melody\nI'm caught in between\nWith a fading dream", "In my defence what is there to say\nWe destroy the love - it's our way\nWe never listen enough never face the truth\nThen like a passing song\nLove is here and then it's gone", "I'm just a singer with a song\nHow can I try to right the wrong\nFor just a singer with a melody\nI'm caught in between\nWith a fading dream", "I'm just a singer with a song\nHow can I try to right the wrong\nI'm just a singer with a melody\nI'm caught in between with a fading dream\nCaught in between with a fading dream\nCaught in between with a fading dream", "Oh what on earth\nOh what on earth\nHow do I try\nDo we live or die", "Oh help me God\nPlease help me"]
