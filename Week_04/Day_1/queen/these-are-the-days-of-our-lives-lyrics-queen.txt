["Sometimes I get the feelin'\nI was back in the old days long ago\nWhen we were kids when we were young\nThings seemed so perfect - you know\nThe days were endless we were crazy we were young\nThe sun was always shinin'\nwe just lived for fun\nSometimes it seems like lately\nI just don't know\nThe rest of my life's been just a show", "Those were the days of our lives\nThe bad things in life were so few\nThose days are all gone now but one thing is true\nWhen I look and I find I still love you", "You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide\nAin't that a shame\nI'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride\nWhen life was just a game\nNo use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did\nWhen you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids\nSometimes it seems like lately\nI just don't know\nBetter sit back and go with the flow", "Cos these are the days of our lives\nThey've flown in the swiftness of time\nThese days are all gone now but some things remain\nWhen I look and I find no change", "Those were the days of our lives, yeah\nThe bad things in life were so few\nThose days are all gone now but one thing's still true\nWhen I look and I find\nI still love you\nI still love you"]
