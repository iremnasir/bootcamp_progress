["I'm a simple man with a simple name\nFrom this soil my people came\nIn this soil remain oh yeah oh yeah\nHe made us our shoes\nAnd we trod soft on the land\nBut the immigrant built roads\nOn our blood and sand oh yeah", "White man White man\nDon't you see the light behind your blackened skies\nWhite man White man\nYou took away the sight to blind my simple eyes\nWhite man White man\nWhere you gonna hide from the hell you've made", "Oh the red man knows wars\nWith his hands and his knives\nOn the Bible you swore\nFought your battle with lies oh yeah\nLeave my body in shame\nLeave my soul in disgrace\nBut by ev'ry god's name\nSay a prayer for your race oh yeah", "White man White man\nOur country was green and all our rivers wide\nWhite man White man\nYou came with a gun and soon our children died\nWhite man White man\nDon't you give a light for the blood you've shed?", "White man White man\nWhite man\nWhite man White man\nFor you battled with lies\nWhite man White man\nStill lies\nWhite man White man\nSay you look around every skin and bone again", "What is left of your dream?\nJust the words on your stone\nA man who learned how to teach\nThen forgot how to learn\nOh yeah."]
