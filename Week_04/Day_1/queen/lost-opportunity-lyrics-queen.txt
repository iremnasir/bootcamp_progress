["Words and music by Queen", "With the morning I face the sun\nI lift my head and smile for everyone\nEvery afternoon you'll find me working on\nI got my new shoes on\nGot to be moving on\nThat's what they say\nEvery night I'm tossed\nAnd I shake my fevered brow\nThinking of my lost opportunity", "Yes every morning I face the sun\nI get so positive with everyone\nEvery afternoon you'll find the cracks showing through\nThey know what I'm going through\nOh yes they do\nEvery evening finds me\nThe optimist behind me\nOn with my lost opportunity"]
