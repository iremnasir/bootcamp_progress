["So you feel that you ain't nobody\nAlways needed to be somebody\nPut your feet on the ground\nPut your hand on your heart\nLift your head to the stars\nAnd the world's for your taking", "So you feel it's the end of the story\nFind it all pretty satisfactory\nWell I tell you my friend\nThis might seem like the end\nBut the continuation\nIs yours for the making", "Yes you're a hero."]
