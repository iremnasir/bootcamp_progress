["I love\nShe makes me\nShe is my heart\nShe is my love\nShe is my love", "I know\nI'm jealous of her\nShe makes me need\nShe is my love\nShe is my love", "Who knows who she'll make me\nAs I lie in her cocoon\nAnd the world will surely heal my ills\nI'm warm and terrified\nShe makes me so", "I know the day I leave her\nI'll love her still\nShe is my love\nShe is my love", "Who knows where my dreams will end\nI'll follow as they grow\nBut the world will know how long I'll take\nAnd if I'm very slow she makes me so", "She is my love\nShe is my love"]
