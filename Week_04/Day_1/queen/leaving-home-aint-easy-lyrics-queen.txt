["I take a step outside\nAnd I breathe the air\nAnd I slam the door\nAnd I'm on my way\nI won't lay no blame\nI won't call you names\n'Cause I've made my break\nAnd I won't look back\nI've turned my back\nOn those endless games", "I'm all through with ties\nI'm all tired of tears\nI'm a happy man\nDon't it look that way?\nShaking dust from my shoes\nThere's a road ahead\nAnd there's no way back home\nOhh but I have to say\nLeaving home ain't easy\nOh I never thought it would be easy\nLeaving on your own\nOh is the main thing calling me back?", "Leaving home ain't easy", "On the one your leaving home", "Stay my love my love please stay\nStray my love what's wrong my love?\nWhat's right my love?\nOhh leaving home ain't easy\nI thought how could I think of leaving\nLeaving on your own\nStill trying to persuade me that\nLeaving home ain't necessary\nLeave the only way\nLeaving home ain't easy\nBut may be the only way"]
