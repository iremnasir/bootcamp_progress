["Words and music by Queen", "Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day\nJust minding my business thinking my thoughts\nNothing much to say\nWhen suddenly I got hit\nImagine my suprise\nYour smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes\nI'd never seen anything to compare with your smile\nI'd never seen anything that came within miles\nMy heart got hijacked by you", "Stuck in the traffic\nStuck at the lights what do I see\nSome stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me\nShe takes off\nImagine my disgust\nLike a bat out of hell\nI get to eat her dust\nI never had known anything to compare with her laugh\nI'd never known anything that counted by half\nMy heart got hijacked by you", "Hijack my heart\nHijack my heart\nSteals my heart", "Hijack my heart\nHijack my heart", "Look at the cities\nLook at the streets what do you see\nLook at the faces look at the people they all want to be\nSuddenly hit by something they don't get to choose\nIt comes out of nowhere\nRight out of the blue\nI'd never seen anything to compare with your smile\nI'd never seen anything that came within miles\nMy heart got hijacked by you", "Hijack my heart\nNow you really got a hold on me\nYou hijacked my heart\nDon't you know you won't let me be\nStole my heart\nThrew away the key\nOooee baby what's become of me\nYou hijacked my heart\nNow you really got a hold on me\nHijack my heart"]
