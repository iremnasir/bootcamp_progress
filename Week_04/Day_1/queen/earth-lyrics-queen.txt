["Words and music by Tim Staffell", "I might be at a table\nAnd suddenly I'll catch\nA fleeting vision of her crystal seas\nOr I might be standing in a crowded dockyard faraway\nUnderneath the sun I've never seen\n'Cos I have seen many worlds\nFor what it's worth\nBut I'll never see again the planet earth\nMy earth\nI might be chasing waves of light\nOut towards the rim\nWhere stars are sparse\nAnd the cold of space seeps in\nBut I might be in a bar room\nDrinking methylated gin\nAnd thinking of the places I have been\nYes I have seen many worlds\nFor what it's worth\nBut I'll never see again the planet earth\nMy earth\nI have seen many worlds\nFor what it's worth\nBut I'll never see again the planet earth\nMy earth\nCast adrift amongst the stars\nI float from sun to sun\nDreaming of the world that gave me birth\nAll the places I have been\nRemind me there is none\nTo match the green living hills of earth\n'Cos I have seen many worlds\nFor what it's worth\nBut I'll never see again the planet earth\nMy earth"]
