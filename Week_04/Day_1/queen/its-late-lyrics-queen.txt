["You say you love me\nAnd I hardly know your name\nAnd if I say I love you in the candlelight\nThere's no one but myself to blame\nBut there's something inside\nThat's turning my mind away\nOh how I could love you\nIf I could let you stay", "It's late - but I'm bleeding deep inside\nIt's late - is it just my sickly pride?\nToo late - even now the feeling seems to steal away\nSo late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say\nIt's late it's late it's late\nBut not too late", "The way you love me\nIs the sweetest love around\nBut after all this time\nThe more I'm trying\nThe more I seem to let you down\nNow you tell me you're leaving\nAnd I just can't believe it's true\nOh you know that I can love you\nThough I know I can't be true\nOh you made me love you\nDon't tell me that we're through", "It's late - but it's driving me so mad\nIt's late - yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's\nToo late - save our love you can't turn out the lights\nSo late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right\nIt's late it's late it's late\nBut not too late", "- I've been so long\n- You've been so long\n- We've been so long tryin' to work it out\n- I ain't got long\n- You ain't got long\n- We gotta know what this life is all about", "Too late much too late\nYou're staring at me\nWith suspicion in your eye\nYou say what game are you playing?\nWhat's this that you're saying?\nI know that I can't reply\nIf I take you tonight\nIs it making my life a lie?\nOh you make me wonder\nDid I live my life alright?", "It's late - but it's time to set me free\nIt's late - yes I know but there's no way it has to be\nToo late - so let the fire take our bodies this night\nSo late - so let the waters take our guilt in the tide\nIt's late it's late it's late it's late\nIt's late it's late it's late it's late\nIt's all too late"]
