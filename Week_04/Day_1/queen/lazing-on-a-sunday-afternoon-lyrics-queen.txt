["I go out to work on Monday morning\nTuesday I go off to honeymoon\nI'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down,\nI'll be lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\nBicycling on every Wednesday evening\nThursday I go waltzing to the Zoo\nI come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy,\nFridays I go painting in the Louvre\nI'm bound to be proposing on a Saterday night\n(There he goes again)\nI'll be lazing on a Sunday\nlazing on a Sunday\nlazing on a Sunday Afternoon."]
