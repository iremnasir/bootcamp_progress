["Love of my life, you've hurt me\nYou've broken my heart and now you leave me\nLove of my life can't you see\nBring it back, bring it back\nDon't take it away from me\nBecause you don't know -\nWhat it means to me", "Love of my life, don't leave me\nYou've stolen my love and now desert me\nLove of my life can't you see\nBring it back, bring it back\nDon't take it away from me\nBecause you don't know -\nWhat it means to me", "You will remember\nWhen this is blown over\nAnd everything's all by the way\nWhen I grow older\nI will be there at your side to remind you\nHow I still love you - I still love you", "Ooooo\nHurry back, hurry back\nDont take it away from me\nBecause you don't know\nWhat it means to me", "Love of my life\nLove of my life ...\nOooh, ooooh."]
