["Just one year of love\nis better than a lifetime alone\nOne sentimental moment in your arms\nis like a shooting star right through my heart\nIt's always a rainy day without you\nI'm a prisoner of love inside you\nI'm falling apart all around you - yeah\nMy heart cries out to your heart\nI'm lonely but you can save me\nMy hand reaches out for your hand\nI'm cold but you light the fire in me\nMy lips search for your lips\ni'm hungry for your touch\nThere's so much left unspoken\nand all i can do is surrender\nto the moment, just surrender\nYeah!\nAnd no one ever told me that love would hurt so much\noooh yes it hurts\nand pain is so close to pleasure\nAnd all I can do is surrender, to your love\nOoooh, just surrender to your love\nJust one year of love\nis better than a lifetime alone\nOne sentimental moment in your arms\nis like a shooting star right through my heart\nIt's always a rainy day without you\ni'm a prisoner of love inside you\nI'm falling apart, all around you\nAnd all I can do is surrender"]
