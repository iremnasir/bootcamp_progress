["Words and music by Brian May and Tim Staffell", "In the bright shop window sits the polar bear\nMakes the children's eyes light up to see him there\nAmongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile\nTo see him as you'd see a star\nLove him from where you are\nHe's not for, not for, not for sale\nPast an open window walks the pretty girl\nDoes she see me at her feet it's hard to tell\nBut if I ask her she might turn her smile away\nTo see her as I'd see a star\nLove her from where you are\nShe's not for, not for, not for sale\nI guess I'll learn to look\nWithout a grasping hand\nMinor contentment wears a smile\nI love her from where I lie\nHe's not for, not for, not for sale\nNot for sale"]
