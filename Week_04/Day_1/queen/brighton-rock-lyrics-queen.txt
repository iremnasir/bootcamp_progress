["Happy little day\nJimmy went away\nMet his little Jenny on a\npublic holiday\nA happy pair they made\nso decorously laid\n'Neath the gay illuminations", "all along the promenade\n\"It's so good to know there's still a little\nmagic in the air\nI'll\nweave my spell\"\n\"Jenny will you stay\ntarry with me pray", "Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me", "love, what do you say\"\n\"Oh no I must away", "to my Mum in disarray\nIf my mother should discover", "how I spent my holiday\nIt would be of small avail to talk of\nmagic in the air\nI'll say farewell\"\nO Rock of Ages\ndo not crumble\nlove is breathing still\nO Lady Moon shine down\na little people magic if you will\nJenny pines away\nwrites a letter everyday\n\"We must ever be together\nnothing can my love erase\"\n\"Oh no I'm compromised\nI must apologize\nIf my lady should discover\nhow I spent my holidays...\"\nooohh ooo ooo"]
