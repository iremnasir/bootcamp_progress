["Baby you've been had\nI am forever searching high and low\nBut why does everybody tell me no\nNeptune of the seas\nHave you an answer for me please\nAnd the lily of the valley doesn't know\nI lie in wait with open eyes\nI carry on through stormy skies\nI follow every course\nMy kingdom for a horse\nBut each time I grow old\nSerpent of the Nile\nRelieve me for a while\nAnd cast me from your spell and let me go\nMessenger from Seven Seas has flown\nTo tell the King of Rhye he's lost his throne\nWars will never cease\nIs there time enough for peace\nBut the lily of the valley doesn't know"]
