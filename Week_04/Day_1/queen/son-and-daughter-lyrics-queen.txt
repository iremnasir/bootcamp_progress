["I want you\nTried to be a Son and daughter rolled into one\nYou said you'd equal any man for having your fun\nNow didn't you feel surprised to find\nThe cap just didn't fit\nThe world expects a man\nTo buckle down and to shovel shit\nWhat'll you do for loving\nWhen it's only just begun?\nI want you to be a woman\nTried to be a teacher and a fisher of men\nAn equal people preacher\nWill you lead us all the same?\nWell I travelled all round the world\nA brand new word for day\nWatching the time mustn't linger behind\nPardon me I have to get away\nWhat'll you think of heaven\nIf it's back from where you came?\nI want you to be a woman\nI want you to be a woman yeah"]
