["Fear me you loathsome, lazy creatures\nI descend upon your earth from the skies\nI command your very souls you unbelievers\nBring before me what is mine\nAt the seven seas of Rhye", "Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors\nI stand before you naked to the eyes\nI will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust\nI swear that you'll be mine\nAt the seven seas of Rhye", "Sister I live and lie for you\nMister do or else die\nYou are mine I possess you\nI belong to you forever", "Storm the master marathon I'll fly through\nBy flash and thunder fire I'll survive\n(I'll survive, I'll survive)\nThen I'll defy the laws of nature\nAnd come out alive\nThen I'll get you", "Begone with you short and shady senators\nGive out the good, leave out the bad evil cries\nI challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours\nAnd with a smile\nI'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye"]
