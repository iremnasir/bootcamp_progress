["Happy little day Jimmy went away\nMet his little Jenny on a public holiday\nA happy pair they made so decorously laid\n'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade\nIt's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air\nI'll weave my spell", "Jenny will you stay tarry with me pray\nNothing e'er need come between us\nTell me love what do you say?\nOh no I must away to my mum in disarray\nIf my mother should discover how I spent my holiday\nIt would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air\nI'll say farewell", "Oh rock of ages do not crumble\nLove is breathing still\nOh lady moon shine down\nA little people magic if you will", "Jenny pines away writes a letter ev'ry day\nWe must ever be together\nNothing can my love erase\nOh no I'm compromised\nI must apologize if my lady should discover\nHow I spent my holidays"]
