["Once I loved a butterfly\nDon't wonder how, don't ask me why\nBut I believed what I'd been told\n\"All things that glitter can't be gold\"", "Ooooo ooo yeah\nAll things that glitter can't be gold", "Those jealous minds conspired to say\nJust let that creature fly away\nHow can it be she has it all\nHer pride is headed for a fall", "Ooooo ooo yeah\nAll things that glitter can't be gold", "Oh Lord, what races we run\nSeeking our place in the sun\nReaching and hoping we'll find the right one", "Now every day a new joy brings\nMy butterfly grew golden wings\nIt seems we find as we grow old\nSome things that glitter may be gold", "Ooooo ooo yeah\nSome things that glitter may be gold", "So let us mind what's there to see\nBefore our hearts become too cold\nIn spite of all that we've been told\nSome things that glitter may be gold", "Ooooo ooo yeah\nSome things that glitter may be gold", "Ooooo ooo yeah\nSome things that glitter\nMay be gold"]
