["Calling You\t(George Michael and Queen)", "A desert road from Vegas to nowhere\nSomeplace better than were you've been\nA coffee machine that needs some fixin'\nIn a little cafe just around the bend", "Chorus:\nI am calling you\nCan't you hear me?\nI am calling you", "A hot dry wind blows right through me\nThe baby's crying and I can't sleep\nBut we both know that a change is coming\nCome on closer, sweet release", "Chorus", "Desert road from Vegas to nowhere", "Lyrics written by Marjon"]
