["There's no time for us\nThere's no place for us\nWhat is this thing that builds our dreams\nYet tips 'em 'way from us", "Who wants to live forever?\nWho wants to live forever?\nOoooooo", "There's no chance for us\nIt's all decided for us\nThis world has only one sweet moment\nSet aside for us", "Who wants to live forever?\nWho wants to live forever?\nOoooooo", "Who dares to love forever? (Oh, whoa!)\nWhen love must die", "But touch my tears with your lips\nTouch my world with your fingertips\nAnd we can have forever\nAnd we can love forever\nForever is our today", "Who wants to live forever?\nWho wants to live forever?\nForever is our today", "Who waits forever anyway?"]
