["Oh how wrong can you be?\nOh to fall in love\nWas my very first mistake\nHow was I to know\nI was far too much in love too see?", "Oh jealousy look at me now\nJealousy you got me somehow\nYou gave me no warning\nTook me by surprise", "Jealousy you led me on\nYou couldn't lose you couldn't fail\nYou had suspicion on my trail\nHow how how all my jealousy\nI wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride\nNow I'm only left with my own jealousy", "Oh how strong can you be\nWith matters of the heart?\nLife is much too short\nTo while away with tears\nIf only you could see\nJust what you do to me\nOh jealousy you tripped me up", "Jealousy you brought me down\nYou bring me sorrow you cause me pain\nJealousy when will you let go?", "Gotta hold of my possessive mind\nTurned me into a jealous guy\nHow how how all my jealousy\nI wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride\nNow I'm only left with my own jealousy\nBut now it matters not\nIf I should live or die\n'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy."]
