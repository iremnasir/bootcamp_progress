["Standing on the dark canal\nBy the gas works\nCelebrate the cops come by\nWhen the love hurts", "And the medicine man here 24/7\nYou can get it fast in Armageddon\nEveryone on their way to heaven\nSlowly", "Call for prayer\nHas come around here\nIn the morning\nWe wash our faces go to work\nThere is no warning", "That it all gets better when life is straight\nIt's bigger than you\nThe Welfare State\nWe'll keep singing, \"It's not too late\nFor you\""]
