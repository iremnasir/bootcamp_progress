["Mama's got a problem\nShe don't know what to say\nHer little baby boy\nHas just left home today\nShe's got to be the loser in the end\nShe's got to be the loser in the end\nMisuse her and you'll lose her as a friend\nShe's ma on whom you can always depend ooh", "She washed and fed and clothed and cared\nFor nearly twenty years\nAnd all she gets is Goodbye Ma\nAnd the night times for her tears\nShe's got to be the loser in the end\nShe's got to be the loser in the end\nMisuse her and you'll lose her as a friend\nShe's ma on whom you can always depend ooh", "So listen mothers ev'rywhere\nTo just one mothers son\nYou'll get forgotten on the way\nIf you don't let them have their fun\nForget regrets and just remember\nIt's not so long since you were young", "You're bound to be the loser in the end\nYou're bound to be the loser in the end\nThey'll chose their new shoes\nThat's not far to bend\nYou're ma on whom they can always depend ooh ooh..."]
