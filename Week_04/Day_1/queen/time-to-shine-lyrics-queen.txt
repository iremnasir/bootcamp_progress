["With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face\nTo heaven you rise in a holy embrace\nYour feet on the ground your head in the clouds\nAnd you're wondering if you're never coming down", "In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold\nThe myths and the dragons of time will explode\nHere's to a real understanding of truth\nFor compassion and grace to be given their chance too", "Raise up your mind\nIt's time to shine", "A moment down through millennium\nUnveiling the secrets of song to be sung\nWaters of life flowing soft to the touch\nWisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much", "Raise up your mind\nIt's time to shine\nRaise up your mind\nHey, it's time to shine", "Let's awaken from barbarity\nInto a world of serenity\nBeyond the rage of foolish pride\nAnd on to the golden shores of paradise", "Raise up your mind\nHey, it's time to shine\nRaise up your mind\nHey, it's time to shine\nRaise up your mind\nYour time to shine\nIt's time to shine\nIt's time to shine"]
