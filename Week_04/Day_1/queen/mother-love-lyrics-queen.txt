["I don't want to sleep with you\nI don't need the passion too\nI don't want a stormy affair\nTo make me feel my life is heading somewhere", "All I want is the comfort and care\nJust to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love", "I've walked too long in this lonely lane\nI've had enough of this same old game\nI'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong\nBut my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone", "Out in the city, in the cold world outside\nI don't want pity, just a safe place to hide\nMama please, let me back inside", "I don't want to make no waves\nBut you can give me all the love that I crave\nI can't take it if you see me cry\nI long for peace before I die", "All I want is to know that you're there\nYou're gonna give me all your sweet mother love", "Mother love", "My body's aching, but I can't sleep\nMy dreams are all the company I keep\nGot such a feeling as the sun goes down\nI'm coming home to my sweet mother love", "Mother love\nMother love", "Day oh\nDay oh\nDay oh", "I think I'm going back to the things I learnt so well in my youth"]
