["Guilt stains on my pillow\nBlood on my terraces\nTorsos in my closet\nShadows from my past\nLife is real life is real\nLife is real so real\nSleeping is my leisure\nWaking up in a minefield\nDream is just a pleasure dome\nLove is a roulette wheel\nLife is real life is real\nLife is real oh yeah\nSuccess is my breathing space\nI brought it on myself\nI will price it I will cash it\nI can take it or leave it\nLoneliness is my hiding place\nBreast feeding myself\nWhat more can I say?\nI have swallowed the bitter pill\nI can taste it I can taste it\nLife is real life is real\nLife is real\nMusic will be my mistress\nLoving like a whore\nLennon is a genius\nLiving in ev'ry pore\nLife is real life is real\nLife is real so real\nLife is cruel life is a bitch\nLife is real so real\nLife is real life is real yeah\nLife is real."]
