["You call me up and treat me like a dog\nYou call me up and tear me up inside\nYou've got me on a lead\nYou bring me down\nYou shout around\nYou don't believe that I'm alone.\nSweet Lady\nSweet Lady\nSweet Lady...\nStay sweet.\nYou say \"You call me up and feed me all the lines \"\nYou call me sweet like\nI'm some kind of cheese \"Waiting on the shelf \"\nYou eat me up\n\"You hold me down \"\nI'm just a fool to make you a home\nAnd you say\n\"Sweet lady \"\nSweet lady\n\"Sweet lady... Stay sweet.\"\nMy Sweet lady\nThough it seems like we wait forever\nStay sweet baby\nBelieve and we've got everything we need."]
