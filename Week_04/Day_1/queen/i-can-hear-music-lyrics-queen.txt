["Words and music by Phil Spector, Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry", "This is the way I always dreamed it would be\nThe way that it is, o-oh, when you are holding me\nI never had a love of my own\nMaybe that's why when we're all alone\nI can hear music\nI can hear music\nSounds of the city baby seem to disappear\nOh well I can hear music\nSweet sweet music\nWhen ever you touch me baby\nWhenever you're near\nLoving you it keeps me satisfied\nAnd I can't explain, oh no, the way I'm feeling inside\nYou look at me we kiss and then\nI close my eyes and here it comes again\nI can hear music\nI can hear music\nSounds of the city baby seem to disappear\nOh well I can hear music\nSweet sweet music\nWhen ever you touch me baby\nWhenever you're near\nI can hear music\nSweet sweet music\nWhen ever you touch me baby\nWhenever you're near\nI can hear music\nSweet sweet music\nWhen ever you touch me baby\nWhenever you're near"]
