["She won our hearts the arts she loved\nIs painting pictures for free\nWhen she was done she hung them up\nFor all the children to see\nGoodbye April lady\nIt's been good to have you around\nGoodbye April lady\nYou've done a lot for the folks in this town\nThe children learned to read\nShe strung their beads\nIt's sorry she was the one\nAs you can see isn't she good\nShe don't leave nothing undone\nGoodbye April lady\nIt's been good to have you around\nGoodbye April lady\nYou've done a lot for the folks in this town\nShe taught them all to love\nShe was their cream\nAnd we don't want her to go\nBut we know too well\nShe fell in love\nAnd there's no stopping her so\nGoodbye April lady\nIt's been good to have you around\nGoodbye April lady\nYou've done a lot for the folks in this town\nGoodbye April lady..."]
