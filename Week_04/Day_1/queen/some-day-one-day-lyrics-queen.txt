["You never heard my song before\nThe music was too loud\nBut now I think you hear me well\nFor now we both know how\nNo star can light our way\nIn this cloud of dark and fear\nBut someday one day", "Funny how the pages turn\nAnd hold us in between\nA misty castle waits for you\nAnd you shall be a Queen\nToday the cloud it hangs\nOver us and all is grey\nBut someday one day", "When I was you and you were me\nAnd we were very young\nTogether took us nearly there\nThe rest may not be sung\nSo still the cloud it hangs\nOver us and we're alone\nBut Some Day One Day\nWe'll come home"]
