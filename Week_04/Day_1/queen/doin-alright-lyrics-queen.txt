["Yesterday my life was in ruin\nNow today I know what I'm doin'\nGotta feelin' I should be doin' alright\nDoin' alright\nWhere will I be this time tommorow\nJumping with joy or sinking in sorrow\nAnyway I should be doin' alright\nDoin' alright\nShould be waiting for the sun\nAnyway I've got to hide\nGoing back to where the skies are blue\nGoing home to find the one"]
