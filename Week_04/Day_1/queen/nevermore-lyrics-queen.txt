["there's no living in my life anymore\nthe seas have gone dry and the rain stopped\nfalling\nplease don't you cry anymore\ncan't you see\nlisten to the breeze, whisper to me please\ndon't send me to the path of nevermore\neven the valleys below\nwhere the rays of the sun were so warn and\ntender\nnow haven't anything to grow\ncan't you see\nwhy did you have to leave me\nwhy did you deceive me\nyou send me to the path of nevermore\nwhen you say you didn't love me anymore"]
