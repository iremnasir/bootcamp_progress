["There's no time for us\nThere's no place for us\nWhat is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us\nWho wants to live forever", "Who wants to live forever\nOoh", "There's no chance for us\nIt's all decided for us", "This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us\nWho wants to live forever\nWho wants to live forever\nOoh\nWho dares to love forever\nOoh\nWhen love must die\nBut touch my tears with your lips\nTouch my world with your fingertips\nAnd we can have forever\nAnd we can love forever\nForever is hour today\nWho wants to live forever\nWho wants to live forever\nForever is hour today\nWho waits forever anyway"]
