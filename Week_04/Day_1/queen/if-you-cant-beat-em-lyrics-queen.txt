["Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely\nDon't let them get you down\nAin't no use in sitting all alone\nHangin' around for someone to call\nOhh they won't come knocking at all\nDon't run and hide even if it hurts you inside\nSo I said give as good as you get", "If you can't beat them join them\nYou better do it 'cos it makes you feel good\nIf you can't beat them join them\nYou're never gonna help yourself", "Keep your fingers off my money\nDon't try and pull me down\nYou're taking me out to wine and dine me\nTrying to wind me round and around\nInvite me to your little contract Ha! Ha!\nRumour has it that you could play dirty\nI tell you what I'll do about that\nI'm playing at the wrong game yeah!", "If you can't beat them join them\nYou've got to do it 'cos it makes you feel good\nIf you can't beat them join them\nYou're never gonna help yourself", "If you can't beat them join them\nYou've got to do it 'cos it makes you feel good\nIf you can't beat them join them\nIt's everyone for themselves"]
