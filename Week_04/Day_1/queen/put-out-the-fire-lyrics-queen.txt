["They called him a hero\nIn the land of the free\nBut he wouldn't shake my hand boy\nHe disappointed me\nSo I got my handgun\nAnd I blew him away\nThat critter was a bad guy\nI had to make him pay\nYou might fear for my reason\nI don't care what they say\nLook out baby it's the season\nFor the mad masquerade\nPut out the fire\nYou need a bullet like a hole in the head\nPut out the fire\nDon't believe what your grandaddy said\nShe was my lover\nIt was a shame that she died\nBut the constitution's right on my side\nCos I caught my lover in my neighbour's bed\nI got retribution, filled 'em full of lead\nI've been told it's the fashion\nTo let me on the streets again\nIt's nothing but a crime of passion\nAnd I'm not to blame\nPut out the fir\nAnd let your sons and your daughters\nSleep sound in their beds\nYou know a gun never killed nobody\nYou can ask anyone\nPeople get shot by people\nPeople with guns\nPut out the fire\nYou need a gun like a hole in the head\nOut out the fire\nJust tell me that old fashioned gun law!!!!!!\nis dead"]
