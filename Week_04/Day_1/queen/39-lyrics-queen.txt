["In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers\nIn the days when lands were few\nHere the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn\nThe sweetest sight ever seen", "And the night followed day\nAnd the story tellers say\nThat the score brave souls inside\nUm, for many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas\nNever looked back, never feared, never cried", "Don't you hear my call though you're many years away\nDon't you hear me calling you\nWrite your letters in the sand\nFor the day I take your hand\nIn the land that our grandchildren knew", "In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue\nThe volunteers came home that day\nAnd they bring good news of a world so newly born\nThough their hearts so heavenly weigh\nFor the earth is old and grey, little darling went away\nBut my love this cannot be\nFor so many years have gone though I'm older but a year\nYour mothers eyes from your eyes cry to me", "Don't you hear my call though you're many years away\nDon't you hear me calling you\nWrite your letters in the sand\nFor the day I take your hand\nIn the land that our grandchildren knew", "Don't you hear my call though you're many years away\nDon't you hear me calling you\nAll your letters in the sand\nCannot heal me like your hand\nFor my life still ahead - pity me"]
