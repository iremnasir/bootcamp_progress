["Queen\nMiscellaneous\nLas Palabras De Amor (The Words Of Love)\nDon't touch me now\nDon't hold me now\nDon't break the spell darling, now you are\nnear\nLook in my eyes\nAnd speak to me\nThe special promises I want to hear\nLas palabras de amor\nLet me hear the words of love\nDespacito mi amor\nLove me slow and gently\nOne foolish world, so many souls\nSenselessly hurled through the never ending\ncold\nAnd all for fear, and all for greed\nSpeak any tongue but for God's sake we\nneed\nLet me hear the words of love\nDespacito mi amor\nLet me know, this night and evermore\nThis room is bare\nThis night is cold\nWe're apart and I'm growing old\nBut while we live, we'll meet again\nSo then my love we may whisper once more\nIt's you I adore\nLas palabras de amor\nLet me hear the words of love\nDespacito mi amor\nTouch me now\nLas palabras de amor\nLet us share the words of love\nFor evermore\nFor evermore"]
