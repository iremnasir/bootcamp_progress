["Action\nThis street honey is a mean street\nLiving in this street honey needs a mean\nstreak\nWe've got criminals living in this street\nBut there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on\npumping\nLike a jukebox playing the same dead record\nOr a radio in the corner keeps blaring\nI gotta feeling, this world is using me\nThis town honey is a dead town\nLiving in this town honey is a showdown\nBut there's a heartbeat pulse that keep in\npumping\nSome sunshine ray through a crack in a\nshutter\nOr a sight of a light at\nThe end of a tunnel\nStill there's a feeling, this world is using me\nAction this day\nAction this night\nWe've gotta learn to learn to live to love\nYou can't say it ain't right\nAction this day\nAction this night\nYou've got the power, you've got the power\nYou've got the power to love and to live\nYou can't say it ain't right\nYour mind honey is a bleak place\nLiving in your mind's living in a bleak place\nYour mind is coming from a rat race\nBut there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on\npumping\nLike a jukebox playing the same dead record\nOr a radio in the corner keeps blaring\nI gotta feeling that just won't quit, this\nworld is using me\nAction this day\nAction this night\nWe've gotta learn to learn to live to love\nWe can't say it ain't right\nAction this day\nAction this night\nYou've got the power, you've got the power\nYou've got the power to love, to live\nYou can't say it ain't right\nAction\nAction this day"]
