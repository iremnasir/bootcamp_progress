["The machine of a dream, such a clean machine\nWith the piston's a-pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam\nWhen I'm holding your wheel,\nAll I hear is your gear,\nWhen my hand's on your grease gun,\nOh it's like a disease son,\nI'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,\nGet a grip on my boy racer rollbar,\nSuch a thrill when your radials squeal.", "Told my girl I have to forget her,\nRather buy me a new cartburettor,\nSo she made tracks sayin' ths is the end now,\nCars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now,", "When I'm holding your wheel,\nAll I hear is your gear,\nWhen I'm cruisin' in overdrive,\nDon't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive,", "I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,\nI'm in love with my car, string back gloves in my automolove!"]
