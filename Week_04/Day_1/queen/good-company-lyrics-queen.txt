["Take good care of what you've got\nMy father said to me\nAs he puffed his pipe and Baby B\nHe dandled on his knee\nDon't fool with fools who'll turn away\nKeep all good company\nOh, ho, oh, ho\nTake care of those you call your own\nAnd keep good company", "Soon I grew up and happy too\nMy very good friends and me\nWe'd play all day with Sally J\nThe girl from number four\nVery soon I begged her won't you\nKeep me company\nOh, ho\nOh, ho\nOh, ho\nOh, ho\nCome marry me for evermore\nWe'll be good company", "Now marriage is an institution sure\nMy wife and I, our needs and nothing more\nAll my friends by a year\nBy and by disappeared\nBut we're safe enough behind our door", "I flourished in my humble trade\nMy reputation grew\nThe work devoured my waking hours\nBut when my time was through\nReward of all my efforts my own\nLimited company", "I hardly noticed Sally as we\nParted company\nAll through the years in the end it appears\nThere was never really anyone but me\nNow I'm old I puff my pipe\nBut no-one's there to see\nI ponder on the lesson of\nMy life's insanity\nTake care of those you call your own, own, own\nAnd keep good company"]
