["I like to sit here in the sunshine\nThe trees in the fields are green sublime\nSuspended in time\nAnd don't it make you feel small?", "I like to sit here by the fire's light\nThe trees in the fields lie bare to the night\nThe stars burn bright\nAnd don't it make you feel small?", "Everyone needs a place they can hide\nHide away find a space to be alone\nEveryone needs a place they can hide\nEveryone needs to find peace sublime", "I like to sit here in the autumn time\nThe trees in the fields they rustle in the wind\nThe church bells gently chime\nGentle on your mind\nSuspended in time\nAnd don't it make you feel small?", "Everyone needs a place they can hide\nEveryone need to find peace sublime\nOh peace of mind", "Everyone needs a place they can hide\nHide away find a space to be alone", "Everyone needs a place they can hide\nHide away find a space to be alone", "Everyone needs a place they can hide\nHide away find a space to be alone\nEveryone needs a place they can hide", "Everyone needs to find, peace sublime\nOh, peace of mind"]
