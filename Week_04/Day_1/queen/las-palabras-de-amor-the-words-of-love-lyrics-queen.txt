["Don't touch me now\nDon't hold me now\nDon't break the spell darling\nNow you are near\nLook in my eyes and speak to me\nThe special promises I long to hear\nLas palabras de amor\nLet me hear the words of love\nDespacito mi amor\nLove me slow and gently\nOne foolish world so many souls\nSenselessly hurled through\nThe never ending cold\nAnd all for fear and all for greed\nSpeak any tongue\nBut for God's sake we need\nLas palabras de amor\nLet me hear the words of love\nDespacito mi amor\nLet me know this night and evermore\nThis room is bare", "This night is cold\nWe're far apart and I'm growing old\nBut while we live\nWe'll meet again\nSo then my love\nWe may whisper once more\nIt's you I adore\nLas palabras de amor\nLet me hear the words of love\nDespacito mi amor\nTouch me now\nLas palabras de amor\nLet us share the words of love\nFor evermore evermore\nFor evermore."]
