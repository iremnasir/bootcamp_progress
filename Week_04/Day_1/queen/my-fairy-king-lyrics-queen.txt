["In the land where horses born with eagle wings\nAnd honey bees have lost their stings\nThere's singing forever\nLion's den with fallow deer\nAnd rivers made from wine so clear\nFlow on and on forever\nDragons fly like sparrows thru' the air\nAnd baby lambs where Samson dares\nTo go on on on on on on", "My fairy king can see things | He rules the air and turns the tides\nThat are not there for you and me | Ohh yeah he guides the winds", "My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong\nThen came man to savage in the night\nTo run like thieves and to kill like knives\nTo take away the power from the magic hand\nTo bring about the ruin to the promised land", "They turn the milk into sour\nLike the blue in the blood of my veins\nWhy can't you see it\nFire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain\nSon of heaven set me free and let me go\nSea turn dry no salt from sand\nTeeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes", "Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings\nBroken my fairy circle ring\nAnd shamed the king in all his pride\nChanged the winds and wronged the tides\nMother mercury (mercury)\nLook what they've done to me\nI cannot run I cannot hide"]
