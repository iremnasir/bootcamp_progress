["When I'm gone\nNo need to wonder if I ever think of you\nThe same moon shines\nThe same wind blows\nFor both of us, and time is but a paper moon...\nBe not gone", "Though I'm gone\nIt's just as though I hold the flower that touches you\nA new life grows\nThe blossom knows\nThere's no one else could warm my heart as much as you...\nBe not gone", "Let us cling together as the years go by\nOh my love, my love\nIn the quiet of the night\nLet our candle always burn\nLet us never lose the lessons we have learned", "Teo torriatte konomama iko\nAisuruhito yo\nShizukana yoi ni\nHikario tomoshi\nItoshiki oshieo idaki", "Hear my song\nStill think of me the way you've come to think of me\nThe nights grow long\nBut dreams live on\nJust close your pretty eyes and you can be with me...\nDream on", "Teo torriatte konomama iko\nAisuruhito yo\nShizukana yoi ni\nHikario tomoshi\nItoshiki oshieo idaki", "When I'm gone\nThey'll say we're all fools and we don't understand\nOh be strong\nDon't turn your heart\nWe're all\nYou're all\nFor all\nFor always", "Let us cling together as the years go by\nOh my love, my love\nIn the quiet of the night\nLet our candle always burn\nLet us never lose the lessons we have learned", "\n"]
