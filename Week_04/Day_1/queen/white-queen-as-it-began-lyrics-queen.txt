["So sad her eyes smiling dark eyes\nSo sad her eyes as it began\nOn such a breathless night as this\nUpon my brow the lightest kiss\nI walked alone\nAnd all around the air did sway\nMy lady soon will stir this way\nIn sorrow known\nThe white Queen walks\nAnd the night grows pale\nStars of lovingness in her hair\nHeeding unheard pleading one word\nSo sad my eyes she cannot see\n\nHow did thee fare what have thee seen\nThe mother of the willow green\nI call her name\nAnd 'neath her window have I stayed\nI loved the footsteps that she made\nAnd when she came", "White Queen how my heart did ache\nAnd dry my lips no word would make\nSo still I wait\n\nMy goddess hear my darkest fear\nI speak too late\nIt's for evermore that I wait", "Dear friend goodbye\nNo tears in my eyes\nSo sad it ends \nas it began"]
