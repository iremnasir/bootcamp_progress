["Words and music by brian may\nYou might believe in heaven\ni would not care to say\nfor every star in heaven\nthere's a sad soul here today\nwake up in the morning with a good face\nstare at the moon all day\nlonely as a whisper on a star chase\ndoes anyone care anyway?\nfor all the prayers in heaven\nso much of life's this way\nDid we leave our way behind us?\nsuch a long long way behind us\nwho knows when now who knows where\nwhere the light of day will find us?\nlook for the day\nTake heart my friend we love you\nthough it seems like you're alone\na million light's above you\nsmile down upon your home\nhurry put your troubles in a suitcase\ncome let the new child play\nlonely as a whisper on a star chase\ni'm leaving here, i'm long away\nfor all the stars in heaven\ni would not live i could not live this way\nDid we leave our way behind us?\nsuch a long long way behind us\nleave it for some hopeless lane\nsuch a long long way such a long long way\nsuch a long long way i'm looking for\nstill looking for that day"]
