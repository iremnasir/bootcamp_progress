["Empty spaces - what are we living for\nAbandoned places - I guess we know the score\nOn and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...\nAnother hero, another mindless crime\nBehind the curtain, in the pantomime\nHold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore\nThe show must go on,\nThe show must go on\nInside my heart is breaking\nMy make-up may be flaking\nBut my smile still stays on.\nWhatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance\nAnother heartache, another failed romance\nOn and on, does anybody know what we are living for?\nI guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now\nI'll soon be turning, round the corner now\nOutside the dawn is breaking\nBut inside in the dark I'm aching to be free\nThe show must go on\nThe show must go on\nInside my heart is breaking\nMy make-up may be flaking\nBut my smile still stays on\nMy soul is painted like the wings of butterflies\nFairytales of yesterday will grow but never die\nI can fly - my friends\nThe show must go on\nThe show must go on\nI'll face it with a grin\nI'm never giving in\nOn - with the show -\nI'll top the bill, I'll overkill\nI have to find the will to carry on\nOn with the -\nOn with the show -\nThe show must go on..."]
