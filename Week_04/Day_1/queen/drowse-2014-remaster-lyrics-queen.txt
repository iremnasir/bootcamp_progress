["It's the sad-eyed, goodbye, yesterday moments I remember\nIt's the bleak street, weak-kneed partings\nI recall\nIt's the mistier mist\nThe hazier days\nThe brighter sun\nAnd the easier lays\nThere's all the more reason for laughing and crying\nWhen you're younger and life isn't too hard at all\nIt's the fantastic drowse of the afternoon Sundays\nThat bored you to rages of tears\nThe unending pleadings, to waste all your good times\nIn thoughts of your middle aged years\nIt's a vertical hold, all the things that you're told\nFor the everyday hero it all turns to zero.\nAnd there's all the more reason for living or dying\nWhen you're young and your troubles are all very small\nOut here on the street\nWe'd gather and meet\nAnd scuff up the sidewalk\nwith endlessly restless feet\nHalf of the time\nWe'd broaden our minds\nMore in the poolhall than we did in the schoolahll\nWith the downtown chewing-gum bums\nWatching the nightlife, the lights and the fun\nNever wanted to be the boy next door,\nAlways thought I'd be something more,\nBut it ain't easy for a downtown boy\nIt ain't easy at all,\nThinkin'it right, doin'it wrong\nIt's easier from an armchair\nWaves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness\nHave my eggs poached for breakfast I guess\nI think I'll be Clint Eastwood\nJimi Hendrix he was good\nLet's try William the Conqueror\nNow who else do I like?"]
