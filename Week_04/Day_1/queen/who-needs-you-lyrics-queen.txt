["I make it half past six you come at seven\nAlways trying to keep me, hanging round\nYou little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting\nNever contemplating my point of view\nThis comes as no surprise\nI'm a fool, for I believed your lies\nBut now I've seen through your disguise\nWho needs, well I don't need, who needs you?", "Oh I believed you\nWent on my knees to you\nHow I trusted you\nBut you turned me down\nBut it's dog eat dog in this rat race\nAnd it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face\nReaching out, reaching out for a helping hand\nWhere is that helping hand?", "How I was pushed around\n\"Don't let it get you down\"\nYou walked all over me\n\"But don't you ever give in\"\nTaking one step forward, slipping two steps back\nThere's an empty feeling that you can't forget\nReaching out, reaching out for a helping hand", "When I met you, you were always charming\nCouldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine\nYou were oh so so sophisticated\nNever interested in what I'd say\nI had to swallow my pride\nSo naive, you took me for a ride\nBut now I'm the one to decide\nWho needs, well I don't need, who needs you?"]
