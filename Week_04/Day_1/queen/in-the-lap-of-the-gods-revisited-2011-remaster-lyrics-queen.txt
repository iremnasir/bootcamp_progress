["It's so easy but I can't do it\nSo risky\nBut I gotta chance it\nIt's so funny\nThere's nothing to laugh about\nMy money\nThat's all you want to talk about\nI can see what you want me to be\nBut I'm not fool", "It's in the lap of the Gods\nI can see what you want me to be\nBut I'm no fool", "No beginning there's no ending\nThere's no meaning\nIn my pretending\nBelieve me life goes on and on and on\nForgive me when I ask you\nWhere do I belong\nYou say\nI can't set you free from me\nBut that's not true", "It's in the lap of the Gods\nI can see what you want me to be\nBut I'm no fool\nIt's in the lap of the Gods\nWo wo la la la wo\nWo wo la la\nWah wah ooh\nBut that's not true\nIt's in the lap of the Gods"]
