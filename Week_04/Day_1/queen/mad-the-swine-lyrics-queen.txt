["I've been there before\nA long time ago\nBut this time I wear no sandals\nAges past I gave all you people\nFood and water\nThree feet tall, so very small\nI'm no trouble\nI bring thunder and lightning\nSun and the rain\nFor all the people in the land\nA message of love\nI bring you from up above\nAll you children gather around\nCome join your hands and sing along\nThey call me mad the swine\nI guess I'm mad the swine\nI've come to save you\nSave you\nMad the swine\nMad the swine\nSo all you people gather around\nHold out your hands and praise the lord\nI walk upon the water\nJust as before\nI help the meek and the mild\nThe believers and the blind\nAnd all the creatures great and small\nLet me take you to the river\nWithout a fall\nThen one day you'll realize\nYou're all the same within his eyes\nThat's all I've got to say\nJust like before\nThey call me mad the swine\nMad the swine\nCome to save you\nSave you\nMad the swine\nMad the swine\nSo all you people gather around\nHold out your hands and praise the lord\nSo all you people gather around\nHold out your hands and praise the lord\nDon't ever fail me\nMad the swine\nMad the swine\nCome to save you\nSave you\nMad the swine\nMad the swine\nSo all you people gather around\nHold out your hands and praise the lord\nHands and praise the lord"]
