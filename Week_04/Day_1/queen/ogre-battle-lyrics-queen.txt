["Words and music by freddie mercury\nNow once upon a time\nan old man told me a fable\nwhen the piper is gone\nand the soup is cold on the table\nand if the black crow flies\nto find a new destination\nthat is the sign\nCome tonight\ncome to the ogre site\ncome to the ogre battle fight\nHe gives a great big cry\nand he can swallow up the ocean\nwith a mighty tongue he catches flies\nand the palm of his hand incredible size\none great big eye has to focus in your direction\nnow the battle is on\nyeah yeah yeah!\nCome tonight\ncome to the ogre site\ncome to the ogre battle fight\nAh ah ah ah ah\nthe ogre men are still inside\nthe two way mirror mountain\nyou gotta keep down\nright out of sight\nyou can't see in but they can see out\nkeep a look out\nthe ogre men are coming out\nfrom the two way mirror mountain\nthey're running up behind\nand they're coming all about\ncan't go east 'cause you gotta go south\nOgre men are coming home\nthe great big fight is over\nbugle blow let trumpet cry\nogre battle lives for ever more\nyou can come along\nyou can come along\ncome to ogre battle"]
