["I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things\nWe can do the tango just for two\nI can serenade and gently play on your heart strings\nBe your Valentino just for you", "Ooh love, ooh loverboy\nWhat you doing tonight? (oooh, hey boy)\nSet my alarm, turn on my charm\nThat's because I'm a good old fashioned loverboy", "Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)\n(Ooh, ooh), can you feel my love heat\nCome on and sit on my hot seat of love\nAnd tell me how do you feel right after all\nI'd like for you and I to go romancing\nSay the word, your wish is my command", "Ooh love, ooh loverboy\nWhat you doing tonight? (ooh, hey boy)\nWrite my letter\nWe're much better\nAnd use my fancy patter on the telephone", "Yeah\nWhen I'm not with you\nThink of you always\nI miss you\nWhen I'm not with you\nThink of me always", "I love you, love you\nHey boy, where do you get it from?\nHey boy, where did you go?\nI learned my passion", "In the good old fashioned school of loverboys\nDining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine, (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine o'clock) precisely\nI will pay the bill, you taste the wine\nDriving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely\nTake me back to yours that will be fine", "Come on and get it\nOoh love, ooh loverboy\nWhat're you doing tonight? Hey boy\nEverything's all right\nJust hold on tight\nThat's because I'm a good old fashioned, fashioned\nLover boy"]
