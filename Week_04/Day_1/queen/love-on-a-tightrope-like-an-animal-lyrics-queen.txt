["Listen - trapped again\nLove on a lead is what you need\nLove on a leash is what you wish\nLove on a tightrope is what you get\nLove on a steep slope you ain't seen nothing yet\nWhen you smile, that wide wide smile\nThat tiger smile, I'm trapped again\nBe my dog, be my pet, like a nervous tic\nYou just won't quit, like a nervous tic you just won't quit\nYou don't need a doctor, you need a vet\nAnd when you laugh, your crazy laugh\nThat wild cat laugh, I'm trapped again\nLove on a tightrope, love on a tightrope\nOur love's on a steep slope\nLove on a tightrope\nNo don't give up hope 'Cos when you wish upon a star\nMakes no difference who you are\nDon't give up hope our love's on a tightrope\nLike a tiger cat you're where it's at\nLike a crocodile along the Nile\nSo strange and wild, some kind of reptile\nLove on a lead is what you need\nAnd when you smile, that wide wild smile\nThat tiger smile, I'm trapped again\nTrapped again\nThey say never bite the hand that feeds\nJust one look and my heart bleeds\nLove on a tightrope, love on a tightrope\nYou know, our love's on a steep slope\nLove on a tightrope\nNo don't give up hope, 'Cos when you wish upon a star\nMakes no difference who you are\nDon't give up hope our love's on a tightrope\nAnimal eyes - like a real good time\nAnimal lips it's a perfect crime\nAnimal hair it just ain't fair\nLike an animal\nYou're an animal"]
