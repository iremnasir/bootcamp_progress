["Another party's over\nand i'm left cold sober\nmy baby left me for somebody new\ni don't wanna talk about it\nwant to forget about it\nwanna be intoxicated with that special brew\nso come and get me\nlet me\nget in that sinking feeling\nthat says my heart is on an all time low - so\ndon't expect me\nto behave perfectly\nand wear that sunny smile\nmy guess is i'm in for a cloudy and overcast\ndon't try and stop me\n'cos i'm heading for that stormy weather soon\nI'm causing a mild sensation\nwith this new occupation\ni'm permanently glued\nto this extraordinary mood so now move over\nlet me take over\nwith my melancholy blues\nI'm causing a mild sensation\nwith this new occupation\ni'm in the news\ni'm just getting used to my new exposure\nso come into my enclosure\nand meet my\nmelancholy blues"]
