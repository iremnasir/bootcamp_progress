["Words and music by john deacon\nDon't you misfire fill me up\nwith the desire to carry on\ndon't you know honey that love's a game\nit's always a hit or miss\nso take your aim\ngot to hold on tight\nshoot me out of sight\ndon't you misfire fill me up\nwith the desire to carry on\nDon't you misfire fill me up\nwith the desire to carry on\nyour gun is loaded\nand pointing my way\nthere's only one bullet\nso don't delay\ngot to time it right\nfire me through the night\ncome on take a shot\nfire me higher\ndon't you miss this time\nplease don't misfire\nmisfire"]
