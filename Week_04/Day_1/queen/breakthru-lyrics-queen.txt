["When love breaks up\nWhen the dawn light wakes up\nA new life is born\nSomehow I have to make this final breakthru...\nNow!\nI wake up\nFeel just fine\nYour face\nFills my mind\nI get religion quick\n'Cos you're looking divine\nHoney you're touching something, you're touchin' me\nI'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you", "That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah", "Breakthru, these barriers of pain\nBreakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain\nMake my feelings known towards you\nTurn my heart inside and out for you now\nSomehow I have to make this final breakthru", "Now! (Now now now)\nOh yeah", "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\nYour smile\nSpeaks books to me\nI break up\nWith each and every one of your looks at me\nHoney you're starting something deep inside of me", "Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me\nI'm outta control\nI wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy", "If I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh\nThat would really be a breakthru\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile", "If I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthru\nOh yeah\nBreakthru, breakthru", "If I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you", "That would really be a breakthru\nIf I could only reach you\nIf I could make you smile\nIf I could only reach you\nThat would really be a breakthru\nBreakthru"]
