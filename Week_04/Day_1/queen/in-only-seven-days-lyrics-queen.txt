["Words and music by john deacon\nMonday the start of my holiday\nfreedom for just one week\nfeels good to get away ooh\nTuesday i saw her down on the beach\ni stood and watched a while\nand she looked and smiled at me\nWednesday i didn't see her\ni hoped that she'd be back tomorrow\nand then on thursday\nmy luck had changed\nshe stood there all alone\ni went and asked her name\ni never thought that this could happen to me\nin only seven days\nit would take a hundred or more\nfor memories to fade\nI wish friday would last for ever\ni held her close to me\ni couldn't bear to leave her there\nSaturday just twenty four hours\noh no i'm going back home on sunday\nOoh so sad alone"]
