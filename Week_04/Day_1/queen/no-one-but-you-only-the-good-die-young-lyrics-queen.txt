["A hand above the water\nAn angel reaching for the sky\nIs it raining in heaven,\nDo you want us to cry?", "And everywhere the broken-hearted\nOn every lonely avenue\nNo-one could reach them\nNo-one but you", "One by one\nOnly the Good die young\nThey're only flying too close to the sun\nAnd life goes on,\nWithout you...", "Another Tricky Situation\nI get the drownin' in the Blues\nAnd I find myself thinkin'\nWell - what would you do?", "Yes! - it was such an operation\nForever paying every due\nHell, you made a sensation\nYou found a way through", "And, One by one\nOnly the Good die young\nThey're only flyin' too close to the sun\nWe'll remember, forever...", "And now the party must be over\nI guess we'll never understand\nThe sense of your leaving\nWas in the way it was planned?", "And so we grace another table\nAnd raise our glasses one more time\nThere's a face at the window\nAnd I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye...", "One by one\nOnly the Good die young\nThey're only flyin' too close to the sun", "Cryin' for nothing\nCryin' for no-one\nNo-one but you..."]
