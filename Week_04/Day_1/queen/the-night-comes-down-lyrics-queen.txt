["When I was young it came to me\nAnd I could see the sun breakin'\nLucy was high and so was I dazzling\nHolding the world inside\nOnce I believed in ev'ryone\nEv'ryone and anyone can see", "Oh oh The Night Comes Down\nAnd I get afraid of losing my way\nOh oh The Night Comes Down\nOooh and it's dark again", "Once I could laugh with ev'ryone\nOnce I could see the good in me\nThe black and the white distinctively colouring\nHolding the world inside\nNow all the world is grey to me\nNobody can see you gotta believe it", "Oh oh The Night Comes Down\nAnd I get afraid of losing my way\nOh oh The Night Comes Down\nOooh and it's dark again\nAnd it's dark again\nAnd it's dark again"]
