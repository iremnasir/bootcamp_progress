["She came without a farthing\nA babe without a name\nSo much ado about nothing\nIs what she'd try to say\nSo much ado my lover\nSo many games we played\nThrough every fleeted summer\nThrough every precious day\nAll Dead All Dead\nAll the dreams we had\nAnd I wonder why I still live on", "All Dead All Dead\nAnd alone I'm spared\nMy sweeter half instead\nAll Dead\nAnd Gone\nAll Dead...\nAll Dead All Dead\nAt the rainbow's end\nAnd still I hear her own sweet song", "All Dead All Dead\nTake me back again\nYou know my little friend's\nAll Dead\nAnd gone\nAll Dead and gone\nHer ways are always with me\nI wander all the while\nBut please you must forgive me", "I am old but still a child\nAll Dead All Dead\nBut I should not grieve\nIn time it comes to everyone", "All Dead All Dead\nBut in hope I breathe\nOf course I don't believe\nYou're dead\nAnd gone\nAll Dead\nAnd gone"]
