["My new purple shoes\nBin amazin' the people next door\nAnd my rock'n'roll forty fives\nBin enragin' the folks on the lower floor", "I got a way with the girls on my block\nTry my best to be a real individual\nAnd when we go down to smokies and rock\nThey line up like it's some kind of ritual", "Oh give me a good guitar\nAnd you can say that my hair's a disgrace\nOr just find me an open car\nI'll make the speed of light outa this place", "I like the good things in life\nBut most of the best things ain't free\nIt's the same situation just cuts like a knife\nWhen you're young and you're poor and you're crazy\nYoung and you're crazy...", "Oh give me a good guitar\nAnd you can say that my hair's a disgrace\nOr just find me an open car\nI'll make the speed of light outa this place."]
