["One dance whose steps I never could learn\nIt's called The Wedding March\nThe grace that it takes, the grace you deserve,\nRequire a lighter touch\nI know you love dancing.\nOh, I know that you love dancing so much\nI know you love dancing.\nMusic's a wild thing with mischief to prove\nI can't adjust to the way that you move\nMusic's a wild thing whatever the groove\nSome music isn't for dancing\nOne dance whose steps I never could learn\nIt's called The Wedding March\nThe grace that it takes, the balance and poise,\nI still find a mystery\nI know you love dancing.\nSo, I know that you'd hate dancing with me\nI know you love dancing.\nSo, I know that you'd hate dancing with me"]
