["Words and music by Brian May and Tim Staffell", "Know what I said when I saw you crying\nHang on that's folly\nI was reeking the head I believed your lying\nYou're just a bad memory\nMy life was going to be better\nMy why could I never ever see she'd step on me\nWell I talked to your friend just the other day\nI was gonna look and raise a smile\nAnd she hid a smile and she ain't like you\nBeen asleep from all the journeys a little while\nMy life was going to be better\nMy why could I never ever see she'd step on me\nStep on me, step on me, step on me\nNow it's so good I won't waste my time\nOn a two year old picture of you\nOh now that you're gone everything's fine\nBut you probably think that we're through\nMy life was going to be better\nMy why could I never ever see she'd step on me\nStep on me, step on me, step on me\nNow it's so good I won't waste my time\nOn a two year old picture of you\nOh now that you're gone everything's fine\nBut you probably think that we're through\nMy life was going to be better\nMy why could I never ever see she'd step on me\nNever ever see she'd step on me"]
