["Fear me you lord and lady preachers\nI descend upon your earth from the skies\nI command your very souls you unbelievers\nBring before me what is mine", "Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors\nI stand before you naked to the eyes\nI will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust\nI swear that you'll be mine\nAt the seven seas of Rhye", "Sister I live and lie for you\nMister do and I'll die\nYou are mine I possess you\nBelong to you forever", "Storm the master marathon I'll fly through\nBy flash and thunder fire I'll survive\nI'll survive I'll survive\nThen I'll defy the laws of nature\nAnd come out alive", "Begone with you you shod and shady senators\nGive out the good leave out the bad evil cries\nI challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours\nAnd with a smile\nI'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye"]
