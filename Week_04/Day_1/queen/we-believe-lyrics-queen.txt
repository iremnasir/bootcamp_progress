["I believe there's no evil out there we didn't have a hand in\nYou believe it's a time for peace and a time for understanding\nSome of us believe that we are chosen\nAnd if God is on our side we'll win the game\nAnd some of us believe that there's a heaven\nWhen the trumpets sound and the judges call your name\nBut let's get it straight", "I believe there's just once chance in this world to hear our brothers\nYou believe there's a better way to listen to each other\nWe don't get what the other guy is saying\nWe hear the words but we don't understand\nSo around the world the same old anger raging\nAnd we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down", "We believe there's a better way to fight\nThere's a way to make our children safe at night\nWe believe there's a war we could be winning\nBut the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive", "I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows\nYou believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill\nA man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry\nWith courage in his heart to match his creed\nA leader who can build a brand new morning\nAnd match the tide of changes\nMatch the intent with the deed", "We believe there's a deed of obligation\nTo bring reconciliation\nTo make peace with every nation - in our time\nWe believe there's not a minute we should be wasting\nWhen the darkness falls it's too late to fix the crime\nIt's peace that we need", "Every father every mother knows the meaning\nHuman treasure that our leaders do forget\nAnd the bullets fly in the face of common reason\nAnd the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get", "We believe there's a song that's worth the singing\nIt's a song of truth we're bringing\nThere's a way to share the Earth with everyone\nWe believe every creature has a being\nHas a right to respect and feeling\nTo live and breathe and flourish in the sun", "That's what we believe"]
