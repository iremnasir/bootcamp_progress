["Words and music by roger taylor\nIt's the sad eyed goodbye\nyesterday's moments i remember\nit's the bleak street, week kneed partings i recall\nit's the mistier mists the hazier days\nthe brighter sun and the easier lays\nthere's all the more reason for laughing and crying\nwhen you're younger and life isn't to hard at all\nIt's the fantastic drowse\nof the afternoon sundays\nthat bored you to rages of tears\nthe unending pleadings\nto waste all your good times\nin thoughts of your middle-aged years\nit's the vertical hold all the things that you're told\nfor the everyday hero it all turns to zero\nand there's all the more reason\nfor living or dying when you're young\nand your troubles are all very small\nOut here on the street we'd gather and meet\nand scuff up the sidewalk\nwith endlessly restless feet\nhalf on the time we'd broaden our minds\nmore in the pool hall\nthan we did in the school hall\nwith the down town chewing gum bums\nwatching the night life the lights and the fun\nNever wanted to be the boy next door\nalways thought i'd be something more\nbut it ain't easy for a small town boy\nit ain't easy at all\nthinkin' it right and doin' it wrong\nit's easier from an arm chair\nwaves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness\nhave my eggs poached for breakfast i guess\nI think i'll be clint eastwood\njimi hendrix he was good\nlet's try william the conqueror\nnow who else do i like?"]
