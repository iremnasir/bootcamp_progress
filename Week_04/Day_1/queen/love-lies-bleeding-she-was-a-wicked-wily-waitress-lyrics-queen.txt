["Come on, come on\nShe was a waitress she looked real tine\nThe little temptress was so divine\nA symphony of cheap perfume and pretty stale red wine\nShe can wait upon my table anytime\nShe was poetry in motion\nStiletto heels and nylons she moved up to the table\nI could see she had a burger with my fries on\nLove lies bleeding, listen to this, love lies bleeding\nWell we parked outside a city bank\nWe found it all real funny\nThe car was running on all tanks and we stole all the money\nShe was a wicked wily waitress and she should be doing time\nShe was an ordinary waitress now she owns her own goldmine\nHow 'bout that\nLove lies bleeding, now listen to this, love lies bleeding\nShe was a rebel without a cause\nShe was a girl who needed applause\nLove in the future, love in the past\nLove lies bleeding in our path\nWould you believe that it gets worse\nShe had a loud theatrical whisper\nI had a one way ticket to Palookaville\nShe had an equally dangerous sister\nI was out of my league, they were in for the kill\nShe was a wicked wily waitress\nAnd I gave her all my trust\nShe took the loot, gave me the boot\nNow she's rich and I'm flat bust\nYeah love lies bleeding\nNow that was the limit because\nShe was a rebel without a cause\nShe was a girl who needed applause\nLove in the future, love in the past\nLove in the future, love in the past\nLove lies bleeding in our path\nI dreamed this world was quite alright,\nAnd everyone meant well\nWhen I awoke to my surprise\nI found myself in hell"]
