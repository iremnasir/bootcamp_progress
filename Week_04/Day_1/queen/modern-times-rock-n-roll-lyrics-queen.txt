["Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene\nThe old bop is gettin' tired need a rest\nWell you know what I mean\nFifty eight that was great\nBut it's over now and that's all\nSomethin' harder's coming up\nGonna really knock a hole in the wall\nGonna hit ya grab you hard\nMake you feel ten feet tall", "Well I hope that big new baby's gonna come along soon\nYou don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon\nWith the temp'rature down\nAnd the juke box blowin' no fuse\nAnd my musical life's feelin'\nLike a long Sunday School cruise\nAnd you know there's one thing\nEvery single body could use", "Yeah listen to me baby\nLet me tell you what it's all about\nModern times rock and roll\nModern times rock and roll", "Get your high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes\nGet a hair piece on your chest\nAnd a ring through your nose\nFind a nice little man who says\nHe's gonna make you a real big star\nStars in your eyes ants in your pants\nThink you should go far\nEverybody in this bum sucking world's\nGonna know just who you are\nLook out", "Modern times rock and roll"]
