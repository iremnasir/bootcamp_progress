["Seaside\nWhenever you stroll along with me I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside\nMeanwhile\nI ask you to be my Clementine\nYou say you will if you could but you can't\nI love you madly\nLet my imagination run away with you gladly\nA brand new angle\nHighly commendable\nSeaside Rendezvous\nI feel so romantic. Can we do it again?\nCan we do it again sometime? (ooh I like that)\nFantastic, c'est la vie Madames et Monsieurs\nAnd at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean\nThis time of year it's so fashionable,\nI feel like dancing in the rain,\nCan I have a volunteer?\nJust keep right on dancing\nWhat a damn jolly good idea -\nIt's such a jollification as a matter of fact, so tres charmant, my dear\nUnderneath the moonlight\nTogether we'll sail across the sea reminiscing every night (shine on silvery moonlight)\nMeantime (in the meantime, baby)\nI ask you to be my Valentine\nYou say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can\nI'll be your Valentino\nWe'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino\nGet a new facial\nStart a sensation\nSeaside Rendezvous \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so adorable,\nSeaside Rendezvous \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ooh hoo\nSeaside Rendezvous \u00e2\u0080\u0094 give us a kiss"]
