["Doctor said I, I'd be alright\nOh, everything that I believed, it wasn't true\nI found it out when I got close to you\nI thought you were different, like a dream\nThings they ain't never what they seem, whoa\nThought I could trust you with my soul\nBut you can't do that anymore\nThe doctor said I'd be alright, but I still feel blue\nThe doctor said I'd be alright, but I still love you\nLove you, hate you...\nLove you, want you, hate you...\nAh, yeah...", "I'm different\nMe myself, I'm different than all the rest\nI can only speak for myself, but people can trust me"]
