["No more upset mornings\nNo more tired evenings\nThis American dream\nI am disbelieving", "When the gas in my tank\nFeels like money in the bank\nGonna blow it all this time\nTake me one last ride", "For the lights of this city\nThey only look good when I'm speeding\nI wanna leave 'em all behind me\n'Cause this time I'm gone", "Long gone\nThis time I'm letting go of it all\nSo long\n'Cause this time I'm gone", "In the far off distance\nAs my tail-lights fade\nNo one thinks to witness\nBut they will someday", "Feel like a question is forming\nAnd the answer's far\nI will be what I could be\nOnce I get out of this town", "For the lights of this city\nThey have lost all feeling\nGonna leave 'em all behind me\n'Cause this time I'm gone", "Long gone\nYeah, this time I'm letting go of it all\nSo long\nLong gone, I'm letting go of it all\n'Cause this time I'm gone", "If nothing is everything\nIf nothing is everything, I'll have it all\nIf nothing is everything\nIf nothing is everything, I'll have it all", "I am gone"]
