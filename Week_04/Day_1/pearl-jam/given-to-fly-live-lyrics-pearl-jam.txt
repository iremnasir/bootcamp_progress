["He could have tuned in, tuned in, but he tuned out\nA bad time, nothing could save him\nAlone in a corridor waiting locked out\nHe got up out of there, ran for hundreds of miles\nHe made it to the ocean, had a smoke and tea\nThe wind rose up, set him down on his knee\nWave came crashing like a fist to the jaw,\nDelivered him wings, \"Hey, look at him now...\"\nArms wide open with the sea as his floor\nOh - ah, ohhh...", "He's - flying! Woah!\nFlying! Wide! Oh...", "He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share\nHis key to the locks on the chains, he saw everywhere\nBut first he was stripped, and then he was stabbed\nBy faceless men, well... fuckers, he still stands.\nAnd he still gives his love, he just gives it away\nThe love he receives is the love that is saved\nAnd sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky\nA human being that was given to fly", "Flying! Woah...\nHigh! Flying! Woah...\nFlying! Woah...\nOhh, oahh..."]
