["He's got a big gold ring which says \"Jesus Saves\"\nAnd it's dented from the punch thrown at work that day\nWhen he smashed the metal locker where he kept his things\nAfter the big boss say, \"You best be on your way\"", "So this life is sacrifice\nOh yeah\nJumping trains just to survive", "Well his wife and kid's asleep but he's still awake\nAnd his brain weighs the curse of thirty bills unpaid\nGets up, lights a cigarette he's grown to hate\nThinking if he can't sleep, how will he ever dream again?", "So this life is sacrificed\nOh yeah\nTo a stranger's bottom line\nOh yeah", "I've seen the light, oho oh oh oho oh oh\nI'm scared alive\nNearly dead\nOho oh oh oho oh ohh\nI've seen the light\nStill alive", "Yeah\nSo this life is sacrificed\nOh yeah\nWas a dream that had to die\nOh yeah", "I've seen the light, oho oh oh oho oh oh\nI'm scared alive\nNear to death\nOho oh oh oho oh oh", "I've seen the light\nScared alive\nOho ohhh ohhhhh oooohoooo\nI'm here to die\nHere to die\nScared alive\nHere to die\nHere to die\nScared of life"]
