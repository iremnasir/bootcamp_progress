["Once divided, nothing left to subtract\nSome words when spoken, can't be taken back\nWalks on his own, with thoughts he can't help thinking\nFuture's above, but in the past he's slow and sinking\nCaught a bolt a lightnin'... cursed the day he let it go", "Nothingman, Nothingman\nIsn't it something, Nothingman\nShe once believed... in every story he had to tell", "One day she stiffened, took the other side\nEmpty stares... from each corner of a shared prison cell\nOne just escapes... one's left inside the well\nAnd he who forgets, will be destined to remember\nNothingman, Nothingman", "Isn't it something, Nothingman\nOh, she don't want him\nOh, she won't feed him...\nAfter he's flown away", "Oh, into the sun, yeah, into the sun\nBurn, burn\nNothingman, Nothingman\nIsn't it something, Nothingman Nothingman, Nothingman\nCoulda' been something, Nothingman"]
