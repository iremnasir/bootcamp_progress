["She lived on a curve in the road\nAn old tar paper shack\nOn the south side of the town\nOn the wrong side of the tracks\nSometimes on the way into town\nWe'd say, \"Mama can we stop and give her a ride?\"\nSometimes we did, but her hands flew from her side\nWild eyed crazy Mary", "Down a long dirt road\nPast the Parson's place\nThe old blue car\nWe used to race\nOur little country store with a sign tacked to the side\nSaid, \"No L O I T E R I N G allowed\"\nUnderneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd", "Take a bottle drink it down\nPass it around\nTake a bottle drink it down\nPass it around\nPass it a\nTake a bottle drink it down\nPass it a, pass it a, pass it around", "One night a thunder cracked\nMercy backed outside her windowsill\nI dreamed I was flying\nHigh above the trees, over the hills\nLooked down into the house of Mary\nA bare bulb on\nNewspaper covered walls\nAnd Mary rising up above it all", "Next morning on the way into town\nWe saw some skidmarks and followed them around\nOver the curve, through the fields into the house of Mary\nThat what you fear the most\nCould meet you halfway\nThat what you fear the most\nCould meet you halfway", "Take a bottle drink it down\nPass it around\nTake a bottle drink it down\nPass it a, pass it around\nTake a bottle drink it down\nPass it a, pass it a, pass it around"]
