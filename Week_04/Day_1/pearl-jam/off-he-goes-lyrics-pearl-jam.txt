["One... Two... One... Two", "Know a man\nHis face seemed pulled and tense\nLike he's riding on a motorbike\nSo I approach with tact\nSuggest that he should relax\nBut he's always moving much too fast", "On this trip he's taken for a ride\nHe's been takin' too much on\nThere he goes with his perfectly unkept clothes\nThere he goes", "He's yet to come back\nBut I've seen his picture\nWe go way back\nI wonder 'bout his insides\nIt's like his thoughts are too big for his size\nHe's been taken... where, I don't know\nOff he goes with his perfectly unkept hope\nThere he goes", "And now I rub my eyes, for he has returned\nIt seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned\nFor he still smiles...\nAnd he's still strong", "That has grown\nAnd now he's home and we're laughin'\nLike we always did, my same old, same old friend\nUntil a quarter to ten\nHe seems distracted and I know just what is going to happen next\nBefore his first step,\nHe's off again"]
