["When the spoon is hot\nAnd the needle's sharp\nAnd you drift away\nI can hear you say\nThat the world in black\nIs upon your back\nAnd your body shakes\nSo you ditch away\nAnd you close the shades", "Don't try to do it\nDon't try to kill your time\nYou might do it\nThen you can't change your mind\nYou've got a hold on to your time\nTill you break through these\nTimes of trouble", "When you try to talk\nAnd the words get hard\nAnd they put you down\nDon't you stay\nDon't you ditch away", "I saw you singing\nSwinging your mother's sword\nI know you're playing but\nSometimes the rules get hard\nBut if somebody left you out on a ledge\nIf somebody pushed you over the edge\nIf somebody loved you and left you for dead\nYou got to hold on to your time till you break\nThrough these times of trouble"]
