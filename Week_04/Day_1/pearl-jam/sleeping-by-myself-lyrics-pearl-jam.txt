["I should have known there was someone else\nDown below I always kept it to myself\nNow I believe in nothing, not today\nAs I move myself out of your sight\nI'll be sleeping by myself tonight", "I could never go to no one else\nThe hurt don't show but who knows time will tell\nI believe in nothing but the pain\nAnd I can't see this turning out right\nI'll be sleeping by myself tonight", "Forever be sad and lonely\nForever never be the same\nI close my eyes\nWait for a sign\nAm I just waiting in vain?", "I close my eyes\nWait for a sign\nAm I just waiting in vain?", "Oh, I believe in love and disaster\nSometimes the two are just the same\nI'm beginning to see\nWhat's left of me\nIs gonna have to be free to survive\nOh, I'll be sleeping by myself tonight"]
