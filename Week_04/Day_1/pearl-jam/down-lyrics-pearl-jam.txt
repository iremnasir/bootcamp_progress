["Down. Fall by the wayside no getting out.\nDown. Cry me a river dried up and dammed.\nThe names can be changed but the place is still the same.\nI am loaded. Told that all's for naught. Holds me down.\nRise. Life is in motion. I'm stuck in line.\nRise. You can't be neutral on a moving train.\nOne day the symptoms fade. Think I'll throw these pills away.\nAnd if hope could grow from dirt like me. It can be done.\nWon't let the light escape from me.\nWon't let the darkness swallow me.\nSo long."]
