["My lips are shakin'\nMy nails are bit off\nIt's been a month since I've heard myself talk\nOnly advantage this life's got on me\nPicture a cup in the middle of the sea", "And I fought back in my mind\nNever lets me be right...\nI got memories, I got shit\nSo much it don't show...", "Oh, I walked the line...\nWhen you held me in at night\nOh, I walked the line...\nWhen you held my hand and i...", "On empty shells seem so easy to crack\nGot all these questions\nDon't know who I could even ask\nSo I'll just lie down and wait for the dream\nWhere I'm not ugly and you're lookin' at me", "And I'll stay in bed...\nOh, little I've seen there\nIf just once I could be loved...\nOh, I'd stare back at me", "Oh, I walked the line...\nWhen you held me in at night\nOh, I walked the line...\nWhen you held my hand and i\nOh, I walked the line...\nWhen you held me close at night\nOh, I paid the price...\nNever held you in your eyes"]
