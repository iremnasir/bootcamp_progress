["I've used hammers made out of wood\nI have played games with pieces and rules\nI've deciphered tricks at the bar\nBut now you're gone\nI haven't figured out why\nI've come up with riddles\nAnd jokes about war\nI've figured out numbers and what they're for\nI've understood feelings\nAnd I've understood words\nBut how could you be taken away?", "And wherever you've gone, and wherever we might go\nIt don't seem fair, today just disappeared\nYour light's reflected now, reflected from a far\nWe were but stones, your light made us stars", "With heavy breath awakens regret\nBack pages and days that could've been spent\nTogether, but we're miles apart\nEvery inch between us becomes light years now\nNo time to be void or save up on life\nYou've got to spend it all", "And wherever you've gone, and wherever we might go\nIt don't seem fair, today just disappeared\nYour light's reflected now, reflected from a far\nWe were but stones, your light made us stars"]
