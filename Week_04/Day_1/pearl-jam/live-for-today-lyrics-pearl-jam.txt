["we had this bright idea one late summer night\ncandy-coated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door\ni guess the heat got to it, dripped and melted all over the floor\nchocolate-covered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard\ni had to laugh not to cry\nnow all your possessions, all of your things, all of your hopes, schemes, desires, and most of all, your dreams\nall gone away... gone away...\nall gone away... gone away...\nall gone away\n\"live for today\", you said, \"live for today\"\ni had to laugh not to cry\ni had to laugh not to cry, not to cry..."]
