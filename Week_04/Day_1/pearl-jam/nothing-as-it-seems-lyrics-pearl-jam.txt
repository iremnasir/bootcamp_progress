["Don't feel like home\nHe's a little out\nAnd all these words alone\nIs nothing like your poem", "Putting in, inputting in\nDon't feel like methadone\nA scratching voice all alone\nIt's nothing like your baritone", "It's nothing as it seems\nThe little that he needs, it's home\nThe little that he sees\nIs nothing he can seize, it's home", "One uninviting chromosome\nA blanket like the ozone", "It's nothing as it seems\nAll that he needs is home\nThe little that he frees\nIs nothing he believes", "Saving it for a sunny day\nSomething maybe, two tone\nAnything of his own\nA chip off the corner stone", "Who's kidding? Rainy day\nA one way ticket headstone\nAn occupation's overthrown\nA whisper through a megaphone", "It's nothing as it seems\nThe little that he needs, it's home\nThe little that he sees\nIs nothing he concedes, it's home", "And all that he frees\nA little bittersweet, it's home\nIt's nothing as it seems\nThe little that he sees, it's home"]
