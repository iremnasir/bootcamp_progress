["I will light the match this mornin'\nSo I won't be alone\nWatch as she lies silent\nFor soon night will be gone", "Oh, I will stand arms outstretched\nPretend I'm free to roam\nI will make my way\nThrough, one more day in hell", "How much difference does it make?\nHow much difference does it make?", "I will hold the candle\n'Til it burns up my arm\nOh, I'll keep takin' punches\nUntil their will grows tired", "Oh, I will stare the sun down\nUntil my eyes go blind\nHey, I won't change direction\nAnd I won't change my mind", "How much difference does it make?\nHow much difference does it make?", "I'll swallow poison\nUntil I grow immune\nI will scream my lungs out\nTill it fills this room", "How much difference does it make?\nHow much difference does it make?\nHow much difference does it make?\nHow much difference does it make?"]
