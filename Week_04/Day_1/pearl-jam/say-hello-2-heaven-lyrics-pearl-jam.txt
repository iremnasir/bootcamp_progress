["Please, mother mercy\nTake me from this place\nAnd the long winded curses\nI keep hearing in my head\nWords never listen\nAnd teachers never learn\nNow I'm warm from the candle\nBut I feel too cold to burn\nHe came from an island\nAnd he died from the street\nHe hurt so bad like a soul breaking\nBut he never said nothing to me\nSo say hello to heaven", "New like a baby\nLost like a prayer\nThe sky was your playground\nBut the cold ground was your bed\nPoor stargazer\nShe's got no tears in her eyes\nSmooth like whisper\nShe knows that love heals all wounds with time\nNow it seems like too much love\nIs never enough, you better seek out\nAnother road 'cause this one has\nEnded abrupt, say hello to heaven", "I never wanted\nTo write these words down for you\nWith the pages of phrases\nOf things we'll never do\nSo I blow out the candle, and\nI put you to bed\nSince you can't say to me\nNow how the dogs broke your bone\nThere's just one thing left to be said\nSay hello to heaven"]
