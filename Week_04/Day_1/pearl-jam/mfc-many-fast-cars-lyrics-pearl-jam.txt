["Sliding out of reverse into drive, this\nWheel will be turning right, then straight\nOff in the sunset she'll ride\nShe can remember a time denied\nStood by the side of the road, spilled like wine now\nShe's out on her own and I'm high", "There's no leaving here\nAsk- I'm an ear\nShe's disappeared", "They said that timing was everything\nMade him want to be everywhere\nThere's a lot to be said for nowhere", "There's no leaving here\nAsk- I'm an ear\nHe's disappeared\nThere's no leaving here\nAsk- I'm an ear\nFuck it- we've disappeared"]
