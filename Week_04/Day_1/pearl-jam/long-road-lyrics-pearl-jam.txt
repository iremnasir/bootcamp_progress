["And I wished for so long... cannot stay.\nAll the precious moments... cannot stay.\nIt's not like wings have fallen... cannot stay.\nBut still something's missing... cannot say.", "Holding hands of daughters and sons,\nAnd their faiths are falling down, down, down, down...\nI have wished for so long...\nHow I wish for you today.", "Will I walk the long road? Cannot stay...\nThere's no need to say goodbye...(say goodbye)", "All the friends and family.\nAll the memories going round, round, round, round...\nI have wished for so long.\nHow I wish for you today.", "And the wind keeps rollin',\nAnd the sky keeps turning gray.\nAnd the sun is set...\nThe sun will rise another day.", "I have wished for so long...\nHow I wish for you today.\nI have wished for so long...\nHow I wish for you today.", "Will I walk the long road?\nWe all walk the long road..."]
