["The waiting drove me mad\nYou're finally here and I'm a mess\nI take your entrance back\nCan't let you roam inside my head\nI don't want to take what you can give\nI would rather starve than eat your bread\nI would rather run but I can't walk\nGuess I'll lie alone just like before", "I'll take the Varmints path\nOh, and I must refuse your test\nPush me and I will resist\nThis behavior's not unique", "I don't want to hear from those who know\nThey can buy, but can't put on my clothes\nI don't want to limp for them to walk\nNever would have known of me before\nI don't want to be held in your debt\nI'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed\nI'm already cut up and half-dead\nI'll end up alone like I began", "Everything has chains\nAbsolutely nothing's changed\nTake my hand, not my picture, spilled my tincture...", "I don't want to take what you can give\nI would rather starve than eat your breast\nAll the things that others want for me\nCan't buy what I want because it's free\nCan't buy what I want because it's free\nCan't be what you want because I'm...", "Ain't supposed to be just one\nOh, to live and die, let it be done\nI figure I'll be damned, all alone like I began", "It's your move now\nI thought you were a friend\nBut I guess I... I guess I hate you..."]
