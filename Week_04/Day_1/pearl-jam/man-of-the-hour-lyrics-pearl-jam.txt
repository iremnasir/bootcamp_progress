["Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness\nCrashed and on their way\nFather he enjoyed collisions; others walked away\nA snowflake falls in may.\nAnd the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out\nCause the man of the hour is taking his final bow\nGoodbye for now.", "Nature has its own religion; gospel from the land\nFather ruled by long division, young men they pretend\nOld men comprehend.", "And the sky breaks at dawn; shedding light upon this town\nThey'll all come 'round\nCause the man of the hour is taking his final bow\nG'bye for now.", "And the road\nThe old man paved\nThe broken seams along the way\nThe rusted signs, left just for me\nHe was guiding me, love, his own way\nNow the man of the hour is taking his final bow\nAs the curtain comes down\nI feel that this is just g'bye for now."]
