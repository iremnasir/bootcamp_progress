["Here, far away\nOne could feel the earth vibrate\nMoon, changing shape and shade\nAs we all do under its gaze\nYellow Moon on the rise\nYellow Moon on the rise\nRound we go... where we stop, yeah, no one knows\nSo tonight, the moon I go\nYellow Moon on the rise\nAn echo that rings, a bullet unchained\nOne life, one grave... joins the parade\nThe sky grows dark, with fallen stars, who'd come so far\nA headstone engraved\nThe colors turn gray\nThe black and white fades", "Yellow Moon on the rise\nYellow Moon on the rise", "Yellow Moon on the rise\nYellow Moon on the rise"]
