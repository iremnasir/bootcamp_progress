["My lips are shakin' my nails are bit off\nBeen a month since I've even heard myself talk\nOnly advantage this life's got on me\nPicture empty cup in the middle of the sea", "And I fought back in my mind\nNever lets me be right, I got memories, I got shit\nSo much it don't show\nOh, I walked the line, when you held me in at night", "Oh, I walked the line, when you held my hand at night\nAn empty shells seem so easy to crack\nGot all these questions\nDon't know who I could even ask", "So I'll just lie alone, and wait for the dream\nWhere I'm not ugly and you're lookin' at me\nAnd I'll stay in a bed\nOh, blues eyes, I've seen him", "If just once I could feel loved\nOh, stare back at me\nBut I walked the line\nWhen you held me in at night", "Oh, I walked the line\nWhen you held my hand at night\nOh, I walked the line\nWhen you held me close at night\nI paid the price\nNever held you in real life\nMy lips are shakin'."]
