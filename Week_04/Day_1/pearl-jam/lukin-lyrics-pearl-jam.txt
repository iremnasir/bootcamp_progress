["Drive down the street can't find the keys to my own fucking home.\nI'll take a walk so I could curse my ass for being dumb.\nI'll make a right, after the arches, stinking grease and bone.\nStopped at the supermarket people stare like I'm a dog.", "I'm going to Lukin's.\nI've got a spot at Lukin's.\nI knocked the door at Lukin's.\nOpen the fridge. Now I know life is worth.", "I found the key but I return to find an open door.\nSome fucking freak who claims I fathered, by rape, her own son.\nI find my wife, I call the cops, this days work's never done.\nThe last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun."]
