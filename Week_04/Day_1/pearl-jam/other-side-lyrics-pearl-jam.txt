["It's not the same without you up here\nCan't find my wheels\nYour absence is what breeds this fear\nWarm breath and all it steals", "You can't know how it feels to be in here\nAll the dark horse fields, befriendin' me", "Playin' ain't the same without you here\nWe've come to hate the golden rule\nCannot seem to make the dots connect\nThe morning light don't show you near", "You can't know what it's like to bleed from here\nThe blackened world goes white, it goes nowhere", "Oooh Hoo. (x4)", "Death ain't the same without you, dear\nI make the others run and hide\nNew York streets seem to make it worse\nAll this noise inside the quiet", "I can't hold on, the weight you bear\nMy body's broken fast, please lift me up", "You can't know what it's like to be inside\nYour fading melodies can't beat my need", "I'm not the same without you here\nHow can i quit to be there\nSit and stare\nStare.\nBegging for a prayer"]
