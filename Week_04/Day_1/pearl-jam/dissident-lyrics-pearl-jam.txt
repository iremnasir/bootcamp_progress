["She nursed him there over a night\nI wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay\nWhat to say? What to say?\nBut soon she was down, soon he was low\nAt a quarter past, a holy no\nShe had to turn around", "When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded\nA dissident is here\nEscape is never the safest path\nOh, a dissident, a dissident is here", "And to this day, she's glided on\nAlways home but so far away, like a word misplaced\nNothing said, what a waste\nBut when she had contact with the conflict\nThere was meaning but she sold him to the state\nShe had to turn around", "When she couldn't hold, she folded\nA dissident is here\nEscape is never the safest path\nOh, a dissident, a dissident is here\nOh, oh, oh...", "She gave him away when she couldn't hold\nNo, she folded\nA dissident is here\nEscape is never the safest path\nOh, a dissident, a dissident is here\nOh, couldn't hold on\nShe couldn't hold, mo, she folded\nA dissident is here\nEscape is never the safest place\nOh, a dissident is here"]
