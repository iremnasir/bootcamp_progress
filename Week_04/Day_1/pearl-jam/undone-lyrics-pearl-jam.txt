["Last stop on the westcoast line\nSouth of the northern border\nOne small corner on my mind\nEverybody they know me there\nDon't get any second glances\nChances are that they don't care", "World as come undone\nlike they change it everyday\nChange don't come at once\nThere's a wave building before it breaks", "Can't wait for election day\nWhere the nasty occupation\nCorporations rule the day\nPlaying on the pendulum throws\nFarther out to the one side swinging\nHas to sweep back the other way", "The world has come undone\nAnother day and who can wait\nChange don't come at once\nIt's a wave building before it breaks", "All this hope and nowhere to go\nThis is how I used to feel but no more\nThe world has come undone\nLike a game that few can play\nChange don't come from one\nIt's a wave building before it breaks"]
