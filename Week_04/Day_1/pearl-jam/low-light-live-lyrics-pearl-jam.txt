["clouds roll by\nreeling is what they say ... or is it just my way?\nwind blows by ...\nlow light ... sidetracked ... low light\ncan't see my tracks, your scent way back", "can I be here all alone? ... clear a path to my home\nblood runs dry ...\nbooks and jealousy tell me wrong\nI will feel calm\nvoice blows by ...\nlow light ... car crash ... low light\ncan't wear my mask, your first, my last", "voice blows by\ntwo birds is what they'll see ... getting lost upon their way\nwind blows by ...\nlow light ... eye sight ... low light\nI need the light, I'll find my way from wrong\nwhat's real, the dream I see"]
