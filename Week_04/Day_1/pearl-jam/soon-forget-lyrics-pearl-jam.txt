["Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a Corvette\nThinks he'll get the girl he'll only get the mechanic\nWhat's missing?\nHe's living a day he'll soon forget", "That's one more time around, the sun is going down\nThe moon is out but he's drunk and shouting\nPutting people down, he's pissing\nHe's living a day he'll soon forget", "Counts his money every morning\nThe only thing that keeps him horny\nLocked in a giant house that's alarming\nThe townsfolk they all laugh", "Sorry is the fool who trades his love for high rise rent\nSeem the more you make equals the loneliness you get\nAnd it's fitting\nHe's barely living a day he'll soon forget", "That's one more time around and there is not a sound\nHe's lying dead clutching Benjamins\nNever put the money down, he's stiffening\nWe're all whistling a man we'll soon forget"]
