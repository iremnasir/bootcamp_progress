["You're always saying that there's something wrong\nI'm starting to believe it's your plan all along\nDeath came around, forced to hear its song\nAnd know tomorrow can't be depended on", "Seen the home inside your head\nAll locked doors and unmade beds\nOpen sores unattended\nLet me say just once that", "I have faced it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again\nI escaped it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again\nHaving tasted, a life wasted, I'm never going back again", "The world awaits just up the stairs\nLeave the pain for someone else\nNothing back there for you to find\nOr was it you who you left behind?", "You're always saying you're too weak to be strong\nYou're harder on yourself than just about anyone\nWhy swim the channel just to get this far?\nHalfway there, why would you turn around?", "Darkness comes in waves\nTell me, why invite it to stay?\nYou're one with negativity\nYes, comfort is an energy\nBut why let the sad song play?", "I have faced it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again\nOh I escaped it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again\nHaving tasted, a life wasted, I'm never going back again\nOh I erased it, a life wasted, I'm never going back again"]
