["Behind her eyes there's curtains\nAnd they've been closed to hide the flames, remains\nShe knows their future's burning\nBut she can smile just the same, same", "And though her mood is fine today\nThere's a fear they'll soon be parting ways", "Standing like a statue\nA chin of stone, a heart of clay, hey", "And though he's too big a man to say\nThere's a fear they'll soon be parting ways", "Drifting away, drifting away, drifting away, away\nDrifting away, drifting away, drifting away, away"]
