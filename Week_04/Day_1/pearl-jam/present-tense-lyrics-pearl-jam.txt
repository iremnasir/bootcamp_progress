["Do you see the way that tree bends?\nDoes it inspire?\nLeaning out to catch the sun's rays.\nA lesson to be applied.\nAre you getting something out of this all-encompassing trip?", "You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh.\nOr you can come to terms and realize,\nYou're the only one who can't forgive yourself, oh.\nMakes much more sense to live in the present tense.", "Have you ideas on how this life ends?\nChecked your hands and studied the lines.\nHave you ever believed that the road ahead ascends off into the light?\nSeems that needlessly it's getting harder\nTo find an approach and a way to live.\nAre we getting something out of this all-encompassing trip?", "You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh.\nOr you can come to terms and realize,\nYou're the only one who can't forgive yourself, oh.\nMakes much more sense to live in the present tense."]
