["Angel", "Like an angel, fly over your house\nLike an angel, pass out wishes\nLike an angel, I remove the arrow\nLike an angel, I live alone\nI'm not livin' what was promised\nI am close but can't enjoy\nOh, I'm not dyin'\nOh, I'm so tortured, 'cause I see all\nTortured, and all I cannot do\nTortured, all I should have done\nTortured, while I occupied a man\nI'm not livin' what was promised\nI am far from glorified\nOh, I'm not dyin'\nOh, I'm not alone\nMine is not a celestial state with idle hymns of praise\nTime is short, I have an appointment at noon, at noon in Hell\nAcross the waste of space and fields of air I glide, alone at night\nOh please, please think of me, 'cause I'm, I'm by your side\nI'm by your side, I'm by your side, oh...\nI'm... I'm right in front of you... I'm by your side..."]
