["All the thoughts you never see\nYou are always thinking\nBrain is wide, the brain is deep\nOh, are you sinking?", "Feel the path of every day\nWhich road you taking?\nBreathing hard, making hay\nYeah, this is living", "Look for love in evidence\nThat you're worth keeping\nSwallowed whole in negatives\nIt's so sad and sickening", "Feel the air up above\nOh, pool of blue sky\nFill the air up with love\nAll black with starlight", "Feel the sky blanket you\nWith gems and rhinestones!\nSee the path cut by the moon\nFor you to walk on\nFor you to walk on...", "Nothing left, nothing left\nNothing there, nothing here...\nNothing left, nothing left", "Nothing there, nothing left...\nNothing left, nothing left\nNothing there, nothing here...\nSee the path cut by the moon", "For you to walk on\nSee the waves on distant shores\nAwaiting your arrival\nDream the dreams of other men\nYou'll be no one's rival", "Dream the dreams of others then\nYou will be no one's rival\nYou will be no one's rival...\nA distant time, a distant space\nThat's where we're living\nA distant time, a distant place\nSo what ya giving?\nWhat ya giving?"]
