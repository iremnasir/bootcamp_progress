["Don't feel like home\nEase a little out\nAnd all these words alone is nothing like your poem\nPutting in and putting in\nDon't feel like methadone\nA scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone", "It's nothing as it seems\nThe little that he needs\nIt's home\nThe little that he sees\nIs nothing he concedes\nIt's home", "One uninvited chromosome\nA blanket like the ozone", "It's nothing as it seems\nAll that he needs\nIt's home\nThe little that he frees is nothing he believes", "Saving up a sunny day\nSomething maybe two tone\nAnything of his own\nA chip off the corner stone\nWho's kidding?\nRainy day\nA one way ticket headstone\nOccupations overthrown\nWhisper through a megaphone", "It's nothing as it seems\nThe little that he needs\nIt's home\nThe little that he sees is nothing he conceives\nIt's home\nAnd all that he frees\nA little bittersweet\nIt's home\nIt's nothing as it seems\nThe little that you see it's home"]
