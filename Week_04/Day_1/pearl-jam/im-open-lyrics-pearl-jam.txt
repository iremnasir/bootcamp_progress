["A man lies in his bed in a room with no door.\nHe waits hoping for a presence, something, anything, to enter.\nAfter spending half his life searching, he still felt as blank as the ceiling at which he stared.\nHe is alive, but feels absolutely nothing.\nSo is he?\nWhen he was six, he believed that the moon overhead followed him.\nBy nine, he had deciphered the illusion, trading magic for fact.\nNo trade backs.\nSo this is what it's like to be an adult.\nIf he only knew now what he knew then.", "I'm open.\nI'm open.\nCome on in, come on in.\nCome on in, come on in.\nI'm open.\nI'm open.\nCome on in, come on in.\nCome on in, come on in.", "Lying sideways atop crumpled sheets with no covers.\nHe decides to dream, dream up a new self for himself."]
