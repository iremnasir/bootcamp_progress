["Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?.\nThe Lord took her away from me\nShe's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good\nSo I can see my baby when I leave this world", "We were out on a date in my daddy's car\nWe hadn't driven very far\nThere in the road, straight ahead\nA car was stalled, the engine was dead", "I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right\nI'll never forget the sound that night\nThe screamin' tires, the bustin' glass\nThe painful scream that I heard last", "Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?\nThe Lord took her away from me\nShe's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good\nSo I can see my baby when I leave this world", "When I woke up the rain was pourin' down\nThere were people standin' all around\nSomething warm flowing through my eyes\nBut somehow I found my baby that night", "I lifted her head, she looked at me and said\n\"Hold me darling, just a little while\"\nI held her close, I kissed her our last kiss\nI found the love that I knew I had missed", "Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight\nI lost my love, my life, that night\nOh where, oh where, can my baby be?\nThe Lord took her away from me\nShe's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good\nSo I can see my baby when I leave this world"]
