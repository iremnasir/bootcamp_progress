["Restless soul, enjoy your youth\nLike Muhammad hits the truth\nCan't escape from the common rule\nIf you hate something, don't you do it, too", "Small my table, sits just two\nGot so crowded, I can't make room\nOh, where did they come from?... Stormed my room!\nAnd you dare say it belongs to you... to you", "This is not for you\nThis is not for you\nThis is not for you\nOh, not for you... ah, you", "Scream... my friends... don't call me\nFriends, no, they don't scream\nMy friends don't call... my friends don't...", "All that's sacred comes from youth\nDedication, naive and true\nWith no power, nothing to do\nI still remember, why don't you?\nDon't you", "This is not for you\nThis is not for you\nThis is not for you\nOh, never was for you, fuck you\nThis is not for you\nOh, this is not for you... yeah, you\nThis is not for you\nOh, not for you\nOh, you"]
