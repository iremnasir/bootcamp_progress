["Lives opened and trashed,\nLook, Ma, watch me crash,\nNo time to question.\nWhy'd nothing last?\nGrasp and hold on,\nWe're dying fast.\nSoon be over and I will relent.", "Let the ocean swell, dissolve 'way my past.\nThree days and maybe longer,\nWon't even know I've left.", "Under your tongue, I'm like a tab,\nI will give you what you're not supposed to have.\nUnder my breath, I swear by sin, for better or worse,\nA best we began.", "Let the sun climb, oh, burn 'way my mask.\nThree days and maybe longer.\nShed my skin at last... shed... shed", "Let the sun shine, burn 'way my mask.\nThree days and maybe longer,\nWon't ever find me here\nLet the ocean dissolve 'way my past.\nFour days and not much longer...", "Let my spirit pass...\nThis is, this is...\nThis is, this is...\nThis is, this is...\nThis is, this is... my last exit"]
