["I got a car, I got some gas\nOh let's get out of here, get out of here fast\nOh everyone's confused, so I stay in my room\nIf I go, I don't want to go alone", "I hope you get this message, oh you're not home\nI could be there in ten minutes or so\nOh I got my things, we'll make it up as we go along\nOh with you I could never be alone, never be alone"]
