["She comes on like a stone\nBut you don't know where from she was thrown\nLike a burning meteor from miles high\nShes looking for a place to land\nShe said you got yourself some sand\nAnd whatever you'd reply she took as yes", "Now she comes out the deep?\nWith her newly planted seeds and soon you're\nThrown down on your knees and then you're dead\nThen before you know the weeds are all beastly overgrown\nWith all the wild seeds he sews in your sleeve", "You gotta know you'll never let her go\nShe's a lightning bolt!\nLightning bolt!\nLightning bolt!", "Always something and never nothing\nIsn't that the way we're taught to be, to be\nFlipping through the worn out pages\nAnd stages when you knew not who to be\nYeah! yeah!\nUntil the lightning strike sets you free", "You gotta know you'll never let her go\nShe's a lightning bolt!\nLightning bolt!\nLightning bolt!", "The crashing stormy waves erode her shoreline everyday\nUntil the castle of her ways turns to sand\nShe holds her lovely breast as her birds fall from her nest\nFlying towards the great northwest\nAnd with no repair in sight\nThere is no god with such might\nAs you open her world wide with such a view\nAnd your death will soon arrive as she finally decides\nThat all her problems, they won't die with you\nA-yeah!... A-yeah!... A-yeah!\nNever let her go\nShe's a lightning bolt\nNever let her go\nShe's true"]
