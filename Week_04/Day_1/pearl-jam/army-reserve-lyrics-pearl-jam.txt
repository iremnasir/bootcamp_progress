["How long must she stand\nBefore the ground, it gives way\nTo an endless fall\nShe can feel this war on her face", "The stars on her pillow\nShe's folding in darkness\nBegging for slumber", "I'm not blind\nI can see it coming\nLooks like lightning\nIn my child's eye", "I'm not frantic\nI can feel it coming\nViolently shakes\nMy body", "Her son's slanted\nAlways giving her the sideways eye\nThe empty chair where dad sits\nHow loud can silence get?", "And mom, she reassures\nTo contain him\nBut it's becoming a lie", "She tells herself\nAnd anyone else\nFather is risking\nHis life for our freedoms", "I'm not blind\nI can see it coming\nLooks like lightning\nIn my child's eye", "I'm not frantic\nI can feel it coming\nDarling you'll save me\nIf you save yourself"]
