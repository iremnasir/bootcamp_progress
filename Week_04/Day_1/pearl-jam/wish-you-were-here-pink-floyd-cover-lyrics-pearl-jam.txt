["Oh, how I wish you were here\nWe were just two lost souls\nSwimming in a fish bowl\nYear after year", "And now I'm running over\nThat same old ground\nWhat have I found?\nThe same old fears\nOh, how I wish you were here", "So you think you can tell\nHeaven from hell\nBlue skies from pain?", "Can you tell a green field\nFrom a cold steel rail\nA smile from a veil?\nDo you think you can tell?", "Did they get you to trade\nAll your heroes for ghosts\nHot ashes for trees\nHot air for a cool breeze\nCold comfort for change?", "Did you exchange\nA walk on part in the war\nFor a lead role in a cage?", "Oh, how I wish you were here\nWe were just two lost souls\nSwimming in a fish bowl\nYear after year", "And now I'm running over\nThe same old ground\nWhat have I found?\nThe same old fears", "Sure do wish you were here\nSure do wish you were here\nGod, I wish you were here"]
