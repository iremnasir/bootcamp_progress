["Here I stand head in hand, turn my face to the wall\nIf she's gone I can't go on, feeling two foot small\nOh, everywhere people stare, I can never win\nHearing them, seeing them in the state I'm in", "Hey, you've got to hide your love away\nHey, you've got to hide your love away", "Why should I even try? I can never win\nHearing them, seeing them in the state I'm in\nHow could she say to me, \"Love will find a way\"?\nGather 'round, all you clowns, let me hear you say", "Hey, you've got to hide your love away\nHey, you've got to hide your love away"]
