["Pearl Jam\nLive On Two Legs\nFucking Up\nAll right this is Neil Young's song. Let's hear it for Neil.", "Lonely drifter on the hill. Why do I?\nOne must have a heart of steel. Why do I?\nIt's not how you look but how you feel. Why do I?\nYou must have a heart of steel. Why do I?\nWhy do I keep fucking up?", "I can see you on the hill. Why do I?\nAll comatose but walking still. Why do I?\nFlowing curves beneath your flowing gown. Why do I?\nOh, only I can bring myself down. Why do I?\nWhy do I keep fucking up?", "Bowman's pick and dogs that bite. Why do I?\nOh, dogs that howl through the night. Why do I?\nOh, broken leashes all over the floor. Why do I?\nKeys left hanging in a swinging door. Why do I?\nWhy do I keep fucking up?\nGood night for music. See ya tomorrow."]
