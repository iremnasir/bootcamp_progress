["Every photograph is peeling\nthe colors turn to gray, this day\nthere is always memories for days, these days\nan undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced\nby the loss of one he could not replace", "and there's no reason that she'd pass\nand there is no god with the plan, it's sad\nand his holiness is proof, it's said\nhe could only know how you have sinned", "the world swings through a passing fable\na fate we made a way, we say\nholding on, live within our own ways\nhe lit a match, he laid in bed\nhoping their dreams will bring her back, it's sad\nand his holiness is proof, they said\nhe could only love you, it's said", "oh in his last breath, believing\nhe'll make his way\nif she's not forgotten\nhe's haunted\nhe's searching for escape", "if just one wish could bring her back, it's sent\nand his holiness is proof, it's said\nhe will always love you, he said"]
