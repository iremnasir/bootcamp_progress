["Come you masters of war, you that build all the guns\nYou that build the death place, you that build all the guns\nYou that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks\nI just want you to know, I can see through your masks", "You that never done nothing, but to build and destroy\nYou play with my world, like it's your little toy\nYou put a gun in my hand, then you hide from my eyes\nAnd you turn and run farther as the fast bullets fly", "Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive\nA world war can be won, and you want me to believe\nBut I see through your eyes, and I see through your brain\nLike I see through the water that runs down my drain", "You that fasten all the triggers, for the others to fire\nThen you sit back and watch, while the death count gets higher\nYou hide in your mansion, while young people's blood\nFlows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud", "You've thrown the worst fear, that could ever be hurled\nThe fear to bring children, into this world\nFor threatenin' my baby, unborn and unnamed\nYou ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins", "How much do I know, to talk out of turn?\nYou might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned\nBut there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you\nEven Jesus would never forgive what you do", "Let me ask you one question, is your money that good?\nWill it buy you forgiveness? do you think that it could?\nOh, I think you will find, when your death takes its toll\nAll the money you made will never buy back your soul", "And I hope that you die, and your death will come soon\nI'll follow your casket, in the pale afternoon\nAnd I'll watch as you're lowered, into your deathbed\nAnd I'll stand on your grave 'til I'm sure that you're dead"]
