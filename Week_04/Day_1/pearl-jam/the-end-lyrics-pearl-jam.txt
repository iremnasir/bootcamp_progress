["What were all those dreams we shared those many years ago?\nWhat were all those plans we made now left beside the road?\nBehind us in the road.\nMore than friends, I always pledged cause friends they come and go\nPeople change as does everything, I wanted to grow old\nJust want to grow old.", "() Slide on next to me, I'm just a human being\nI will take the blame but just the same, this is not me\nYou see, believe, I'm better than this\nDon't leave me so cold, I'm buried beneath the stones\nI just want to hold on and know I'm worth your love\nEnough, I don't think, there's such a thing.", "It's my fault, now I've been caught a sickness in my bones.\nHow it pains to leave you here with the kids on your own.\nJust don't let me go.", "() Help me see myself, cause I can no longer tell\nLooking up from inside of the bottom of a well\nit's Hell, I yell, but no one hears\nBefore I disappear, whisper in my ear\nGive me something to echo in my unknown futures ear\nMy dear, the end, comes near, I'm here, but not much longer."]
