["Why deny all the troubles when combined\nWith the missing links, it don't feel like home now\nThat you're gone, all the troubles suddenly explained infinitum\nYou're always wishing and never here at home, you", "All the dreams we shared and lights we turned on\nBut the house is getting dark\nAnd I don't want to know your past\nBut together share the dawn", "And I won't need nothing else 'cause when we're dead\nWe would've had it all\nAnd I wouldn't falling from the sky, tell you\nParachutes have opened now", "Heaven knows if there's a ceiling\nCome so low with the kneeling\nPlease know that, that I got\nAll the friends I'm needing, before my lights go out\nAs the doors are closing now\nAnd far away will be my home\nAnd to grasp this, I don't know", "But I don't need\nFurther back and forth, a wave will break on me today\nAnd love\nWish the world could glow again with love\nOne can't seem to have enough", "And war\nBreak the sky and tell me what it's for\nI'll travel there on my own\nAnd love\nWhat a different life\nHad I not found this love with you"]
