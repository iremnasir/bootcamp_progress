["The mind is grey like the city\nPacking in and overgrown\nLove is deep, dig it out\nStanding in a hole alone", "Working for something\nOne can never hold\nA place in the clouds\nGood place to hide, oh my oh", "So I'm flying away, away\nDriving away, away\nFinding hope in ways I missed before\nI miss before", "The TV, she talks to me\nBreaking news and building walls\nSelling me what I don't need\nI never knew soap made you taller", "So I'm riding away, away\nHiding away, away\nSo much talk it makes no sense at all\nMy senses have gone, oh", "So I'm hiding away, away\nDriving away, away\nPassing new friends I won't know at all\nWon't know at all", "It doesn't hurt when I bleed\nBut my memories they eat me\nI've seen it all before\nBring it on, 'cause I'm no victim", "Dying (away, away)\nDying (away, away)\nDying\nDying"]
