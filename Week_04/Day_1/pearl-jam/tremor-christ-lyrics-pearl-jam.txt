["Winded is the sailor drifting by the storm,\nWounded is the organ he left all bloodied on the shore.\nGorgeous was his savior, sees her, drowning in his wake.\nDaily taste the salt of her tears, but a chance blamed fate.\nLittle secrets, tremors, turned to quake...\nThe smallest oceans still get big, big waves...", "Ransom paid the devil... he whispers pleasing words.\nTriumphant are the angels if they can get there first.\nLittle secrets, tremors, turned to quake...\nThe smallest oceans still get big, big waves...", "I'll decide... take the dive...\nTake my time... not my life...\nWait for signs... believe in lies...\nTo get by... it's divine, whoa...\nOh, you know what it's like.", "Turns the bow back, tows, and drops the line,\nPuts his faith in love and tremor Christ."]
