["I shut and locked the front door\nNo way in or out\nI turned and walked the hallway\nAnd pulled the curtains down\nI knelt and emptied the mouth of every plug around\nBut nothing's sound, nothing's sound", "I stayed where my last cap left me\nIgnored all my rounds\nSoon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls\nThey're upside down", "I swallow my words to keep from lying\nI swallow my face just to keep from biting, I, I.\nI swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, diving\nI surfaced and all of my being was enlightened", "Now... I'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding", "It's been about three days now\nSince I've been aground\nNo longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now\nIt's funny when things change so much\nIt's all state of mind", "I swallowed my words to keep from lying\nI swallowed my face just to keep from biting, I, I\nI swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, I was diving\nI surfaced and all of my being was enlightened", "Now I'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding, yeah\nNow I'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding, yeah\nI'm in hiding..."]
