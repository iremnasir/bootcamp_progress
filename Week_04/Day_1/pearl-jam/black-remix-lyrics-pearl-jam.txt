["Hey...oooh...\nSheets of empty canvas\nUntouched sheets of clay\nWere laid spread out before me\nAs her body once did\nAll five horizons\nRevolved around her soul\nAs the earth to the sun\nNow the air I tasted and breathed\nHas taken a turn\nOoh and all I taught her was everything\nOoh I know she gave me all that she wore\nAnd now my bitter hands\nChafe beneath the clouds\nOf what was everything\nOh the pictures have\nAll been washed in black\nTattooed everything\nI take a walk outside\nI'm surrounded by\nSome kids at play\nI can feel their laughter\nSo why do I sear\nOh, and twisted thoughts that spin\nRound my head\nI'm spinning\nOh, I'm spinning\nHow quick the sun can, drop away...\nAnd now my bitter hands\nCradle broken glass\nOf what was everything\nAll the pictures had\nAll been washed in black\nTattooed everything\nAll the love gone bad\nTurned my world to black\nTattooed all I see\nAll that I am\nAll I'll be...\nYeah\nUh huh...uh huh...ooh...\nI know someday you'll have a beautiful life\nI know you'll be a sun\nIn somebody else's sky\nBut why\nWhy\nWhy can't it be\nWhy can't it be mine\n(not sure?)\nmm-hmm no yeah no\nmm mmmm no nonono yeah yeah\nwe-\nwe belong\nwe belong together\ntogether\noooh ooh\nwe-\nwe belong\nwe belong together\noh yeah"]
