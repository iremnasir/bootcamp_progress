["I see the world, feel the chill\nWhich way to go, windowsill\nI see the world's on a rocking horse of time\nI see the birds in the rain", "Oh, dear dad, can you see this now\nI am myself, like you somehow\nI'll ride the wave where it takes me\nI'll hold the pain release me", "Oh, dear dad, can you see this now\nI am myself, like you somehow\nI'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me\nI'll open up release me, release me, release me, release me"]
