["Large fingers pushing paint...\nYou're God and you got big hands.\nColors blend... the challenges you give, man.", "Seek my part, devote myself.\nMy small self like a book amongst the many on a shelf.", "Sometimes I know, sometimes I rise.\nSometimes I fall, sometimes I don't.\nSometimes I cringe, sometimes I live.\nSometimes I walk, sometimes I kneel.\nSometimes I speak of nothing at all.\nSometimes I reach to myself, dear God."]
