["There's a light when my baby is in my arms\nThere's a light when the window shades are drawn\nHesitate when I feel I may do harm to her\nWash it off, 'cause this feeling we can share", "And I know she's reached my heart in thin air", "Byzantine is reflected in our pond\nThere's a cloud, but the water remains calm\nReaching in, the sun's fingers clutch the dawn to pass\nEven out, it's a precious thing to bear", "And I know she's reached my heart in thin air\nYes, I know she's reached my heart in thin air", "It's not in my past to presume\nLove can keep on moving in both directions\nHow to be happy and true\nIs the quest we're taking on together", "Taking on, on, on, on, on\nTaking on, on, on, on, on", "There's a light when my baby's in my arms", "And I know she's reached my heart in thin air\nAnd I know she's reached my heart in thin air\nAnd I know she's reached my heart in thin air\nYes, I know she's reached my heart"]
