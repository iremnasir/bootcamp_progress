["Sailing on my every step\nInching off of the earth...\nIt's magnified\nby the things I've done\nThe thing that I've become", "Every lift of my hand,\nCoffee cup up and back,\nIs magnified\nby the things I've done\nThe things I've seen, the things I've caused,\nI'm a dead man walking.", "The hammer that I once brought down now hovers over me.\nCasts a shadow, a cross/across onto me.", "The hallways are all mocking me.\nWhat I've become they're all mocking me.", "I'm a dead man walking. A dead man walking. A dead man walking.\nI'm a dead man walking. Dead man walking. Dead man walking."]
