["I am wishing you a well.\nMind at peace within your cell.\nCovers up, I cast you off.\nI'll be watching as you breathe.\nI lie still, you move, I send you off around the bend.", "I hold your head deep in my arms.\nMy fingertips, they close your eyes.\nOff you dream, my little child.\nThere's a sun around the bend.\nThere's a sun around the bend.", "All the evenings close like this.\nAll these moments that I've missed.\nPlease forgive me, won't you, dear?\nPlease forgive and let me share with you around the bend...", "You're an angel when you sleep.\nHow I want your soul to keep on and on around the bend."]
