["It's out of my hands making your hands meet\nStumble as it's crumbling out of reach\nIt's in the cards of destiny your sanity in tow", "Designate my luck\nUh, resignate", "This power has no roots to guide, no role\nTrust me, rusted minds refuse to go\nUnwillingness is meaningless to walk away in vain", "Designate my will\nAh, designate my fill\nAh, resignate", "My will is crashing, synapses flashing slow\nAh, days like frame by frame, where do they go?\nAh yeah, why fight? Forget it, cannot spend it after I go", "Roll them high\nThrow them again\nAll gods' dice", "Monkey driven, call this the living? Ha.\nAh, too much thought it's overwrought a hole\nYeah, minding yours what's mine not yours\nWill finish us off", "Ah, designate my life\nAh, designate my view\nAh, resignate my will, my will, my will, I will\nResignate my God"]
