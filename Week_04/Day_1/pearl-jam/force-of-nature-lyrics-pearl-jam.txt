["Understand she's a force of nature\nContraband hiding deep inside her soul\nExorcising her will to lose control\nShe lets go", "A common man, he don't stand a chance, no\nWonderland pulling Alice in the hole\nNo way to save someone who won't take the rope\nAnd just let's go", "One man stands the edge of the ocean\nA beacon on dry land\nEyes upon the horizon\nIn the dark before the dawn", "Hurricane has the trade winds blowing\nA gale force shaking windows in the storm\nShipwreck on the rock that he calls home\nWith one light on", "Somewhere there's a siren singing\nA song only he hears\nAll the strength you might think\nWould disappear,. resolving", "One man stands alone, awaiting\nFor her to come home\nEyes upon the horizon\nIn dark before the darkness meets the dawn", "Makes me ache,... Makes me shake,...\nIs it so wrong to think that love can keep us safe?", "Last I saw, he was out there waiting\nA silhouette in the black light, full moon glow\nIn the sand there he stands upon the shore\nForevermore", "Somewhere there's a siren singing\nA song only he hears\nAll the strength that you might think\nWould disappear, resolving", "One man stands alone, awaiting\nFor her to come home\nEyes are closed,. You cannot know\nBut his heart don't seem to roam."]
