["I have not been home since you left long ago\nI'm thumbing my way back to heaven\nCalm steps walking backwards on the road\nI'm counting my way back to heaven", "I can't be free with what's locked inside of me\nIf there was a key you took it in your hand\nThere's no wrong or right but I'm sure there's good and bad\nThe questions linger overhead", "No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead\nI'm thumbing my way back to heaven\nI wish that I could hold you, I wish that I had\nThinking 'bout heaven", "I let go of the rope thinking that's what held me back\nAnd in time I've realized it's now wrapped around my neck\nI can't see what's next from this lonely overpass\nHang my head and count my steps as another car goes past", "All the rusted signs we ignored throughout our lives\nChoosing the shiny ones instead\nI turned my back, now there's no turning back\nMmmmmmm", "No matter how cold the winter, there's a springtime ahead\nI smile, but who am I kidding?\nI'm just walking the mile, every once in a while get a ride\nI'm thumbing my way back to heaven\nI'm thumbing my way back to heaven\nI'm thumbing my way back to heaven"]
