["Underneath this smile lies everything\nAll my hopes and anger, pride and shame\nMake myself a pact not to shut doors on the past\nJust for today I am free", "I will not lose my faith\nIt's an inside job today\nI know this one thing well", "I used to try to kill love, was the highest sin\nBreathing insecurity out and in\nSearching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight\nPursuing the greater way for all human light", "How I choose to feel is how I am\nHow I choose to feel is how I am\nI will not lose my faith\nIt's an inside job today", "Holding on, the light of night\nOn my knees to rise and fix my broken soul\nAgain", "Let me run into the rain\nTo be a human light again\nLet me run into the rain\nTo shine a human light today", "Life comes from within your heart and desire\nOh, life comes from within my heart and desire\nOh, life comes from within your heart and desire", "Yeah, yeah\nRun in rain"]
