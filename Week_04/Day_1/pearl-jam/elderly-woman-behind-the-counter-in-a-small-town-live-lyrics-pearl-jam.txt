["I seem to recognize your face\nHaunting, familiar yet, I can't seem to place it\nCannot find the candle of thought to light your name\nLifetimes are catching up with me", "All these changes taking place\nI wish I'd seen the place\nBut no one's ever taken me", "Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away\nHearts and thoughts they fade, fade away", "I swear, I recognize your breath\nMemories like fingerprints are slowly raising\nMe, you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former\nIt's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf", "I changed by not changing at all\nSmall town predicts my fate\nPerhaps that's what no one wants to see\nI just want to scream hello", "Well, my God it's been too long\nNever dreamed You'd return\nBut now here You are and here I am", "Hearts and thoughts they fade away", "Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away\nHearts and thoughts they fade, fade away\nHearts and thoughts they fade away\nHearts and thoughts they fade, fade away\nFade away, fade away"]
