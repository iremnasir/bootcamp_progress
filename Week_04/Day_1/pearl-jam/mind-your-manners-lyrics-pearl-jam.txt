["I got an unfortunate feeling, I been beaten down\nI feel that I'm done believing, now the truth is coming out", "What they're taking is, more than a vow\nThey're taking young innocents, and then they throw 'em on a burning pile, ah ah ay ay\nAnd all along they're saying... \"Mind your manners!\"", "I caught myself believing that I needed God\nAnd if it's out there somewhere we sure could use hymn now", "Try my patience! My patience tried\nThis world's a long love letter that makes me want to cry, ah ah ay ay", "All along they're saying... \"Mind your manners!\"\nThat's all they're saying\nSelf-realized and metaphysically redeemed\nMay not live another life, may not solve our mystery\nRight round the corner could be bigger than ourselves\nWe could will it to the sky, or we could something else", "And all along they're saying... \"Mind your manners!\"\nAlways praying\nSelf-realized and metaphysically redeemed\nMay not live another life, may not solve our mystery\nRight round the corner could be bigger than ourselves\nWe could will it to the sky, or we could something else\nGo to heaven, that's swell... how you like your living in hell?"]
