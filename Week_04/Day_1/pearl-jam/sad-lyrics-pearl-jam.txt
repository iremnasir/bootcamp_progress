["All the photographs were peeling\nAnd colors turned to gray, he stayed\nin his room with memories for days, he faced\nan undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced\nby the loss of one what he could not replace", "There's no reason that she passed\nand there is no god with a plan, it's sad\nand his loneliness is proof, it's sad\nhe could only love you, it's sad", "The door swings to a passing fable\na fate we may delay, we say\nholding on, delivered in our own brace\neleven nights he laid in bed\nhoping that dreams will bring her back, it's sad\nand his loneliness is proof, it's sad\nhe could only love you, it's sad", "Holding his last breath, believing\nhe'll make his way\nbut she's not forgotten\nhe's haunted\nhe's searching for escape\nIf just one wish could bring her back, it's send\nand his loneliness is proof, it's sad\nhe will always love you, it's sad"]
