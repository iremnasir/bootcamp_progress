["Thieves in the window\nTrouble down the hall\nThe resin white ceiling\nBlood, dripping, flows\nOut on the front line\nPreachers sweep the earth\nOut on their backsides\nWith nothing in common, with no problem", "She's just a girl...\nJust... just a girl, yeah...\nJust one time around\nShe has little chance to make good\nDistance of her lie\nDecided in the woods", "Burning fires\nShe's led to police\nThis maid in progress\nBetrayin' your mother's need for a shelter", "Oh, just a girl\nJust... just a girl\nJust one time around\nShe had little chance to make good\nTreats them now, she's young\nBut it can be taken away\nJust one time around... can be taken away\nWe all make mistakes", "Hush my baby... don't you cry...\nYou're my little alibi\nOh baby, please... I need some sleep\nHmm, now be taking\nYou with me", "Just a girl (5x)\nJust a kid, yeah..."]
