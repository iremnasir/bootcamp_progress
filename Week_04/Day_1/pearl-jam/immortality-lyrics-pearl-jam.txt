["Vacate is the word...\nvengeance has no place on me or her\nCannot find the comfort in this world\nArtificial tear...\nvessel stabbed, next up, volunteers\nVulnerable, wisdom can't adhere...", "A truant finds home... and a wish to hold on...\nBut there's a trapdoor in the sun...\nImmortality...", "As privileged as a whore...\nvictims in demand for public show\nSwept out through the cracks beneath the door\nHolier than thou, how?\nSurrendered... executed, anyhow\nScrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor...", "A truant finds home... and a wish to hold on too...\nHe saw the trapdoor in the sun...", "I cannot stop the thought... I'm running in the dark...\nComing up a which way sign...\nall good truants must decide...\nOh, stripped and sold, mom...\nAuctioned forearm...\nAnd whiskers in the sink...\nTruants move on... cannot stay long\nSome die just to live...\nOhh..."]
