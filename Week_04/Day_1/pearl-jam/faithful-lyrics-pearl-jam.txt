["Plaque on the wall says that no one's slept here \nIt's rare to come upon a bridge that has not been around \nOr been stepped on \nWhatever the notions we laced in our prayers \nThe man upstairs is used to all of this noise \nI'm through with screaming ", "And echoes nobody hears it goes it goes it goes \nLike echoes nobody hears it goes it goes it goes \nWe're faithful we all believe we all believe it {4X} ", "And echoes nobody hears, it goes, it goes, it goes {2X} \nWe're faithful, we all believe, we all believe it {3X} \nSo faithful, we all believe, we all believe it ", "M.Y.T.H. is? \nBelief in the game controls that keeps us in a box of fear \nWe never listen \nVoice inside so drowned out \nDrowned you are, you are... \nYou are everything, and everything is you \nMe, you... you, me. It's all related \nWhat's a boy to do? \nJust be darling and I will be too \nFaithful to you"]
