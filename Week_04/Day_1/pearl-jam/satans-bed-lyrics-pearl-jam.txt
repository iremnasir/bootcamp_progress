["It's not all been said... been said and done...\nI've never slept in Satan's bed\nAlthough I must admit... still visits my place\nUninvited, as you know, he don't wait\nFunny how he always seems to fit in\nFunny how I always want to give in\nSundays, Fridays, Tuesdays, Thursday, the same\nSometimes the special guest, he don't like to leave\nAlready... in love... (3x)\nAlready...", "Who made, who made up, made up the myth\nThat we were born to be covered in bliss?\nWho set the standard, born to be rich?\nSuch fine examples, skinny little bitch\nModel, role model, roll some models in blood\nGet some flesh to stick, so they look like us\nI shit and I stink, I'm real, join the club\nI'd stop and talk, but I'm already in love", "Already... in love... (3x)\nAlready...", "In love... Ah ha ha ha...\n...follows torture... follows reward... (2x)\nOh, oh my butt...", "Never shook Satan's hand, look see for yourself\nYou'd know it if I had, that shit don't come off\nI'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both\nJump off a cliff, don't need your help so back off\nI'll never suck Satan's dick...\nAgain, you'd see it, you know, right round the lips\nI'll wait for an angel, but I won't hold my breath\n'Magine they're busy, think I'm doing okay...\nAlready... in love... (6x)\nAlready..."]
