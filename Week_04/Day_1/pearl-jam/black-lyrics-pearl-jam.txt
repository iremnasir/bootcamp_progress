["Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay\nWere laid spread out before me, as her body once did\nAll all five horizons, revolved around her soul...\nAs the Earth to the Sun\nNow, the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn", "Ooh, and all I taught her was... everything\nOoh, I know she gave me all... that she wore\nAnd now my bitter hands, chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything\nAll the pictures have all been washed in black\nTattooed everything", "I take a walk outside\nI'm surrounded by some kids at play\nI can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?", "Mmm, and twisted thoughts that spin around my head\nI'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning\nHow quick the Sun can drop away\nAnd now my bitter hands cradle broken glass... of what was everything\nAll the pictures have, all been washed in black\nTattooed everything", "All the love gone bad, turned my world to black\nTattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be, yeah", "I know that someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star\nIn somebody else's sky...\nBut why, why, why can't it be... can't it be mine?\nAh, yeah"]
