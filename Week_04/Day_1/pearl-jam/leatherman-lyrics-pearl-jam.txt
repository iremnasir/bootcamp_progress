["I know about a man to whom I may be related, he's leatherman.\nDied a long time ago in the 1880's... leatherman, leatherman.\nCovered with leather, but it wasn't tight.\nUnderneath the moon in the woods at night...", "Makin' the rounds ten miles a day,\nOnce a month they'd spot him, here's what they'd say...\n\"Here he comes, he's a man of the land.\nHe's leatherman. Smile on his face, an axe in his pack.\nHe's leatherman.\"", "Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed.\nWasn't known to say but \"Thanks for the bread.\"", "So modern day I walk my way, my jacket faded,\nJust like a man of leather whom I may be related.", "Rolled a cigarette, but when he asked for a light,\nI thought he'd be an animal, but so polite.", "Makin' the rounds ten miles a day.\nOnce a month they'd spot him and here's what they'd say...\n\"Here he comes, he's a man of the land, he's leatherman.\nSmile on his face, an axe in his hand.\nHe's leatherman.\"", "Shake his hand he's leatherman.\nBake some bread he's leatherman.\nShame he's dead. I saw his bed,\nIt's all that's left of leatherman.", "Give me some skin, leatherman."]
