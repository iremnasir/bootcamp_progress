["When the Kingdom comes\nHe puts his records on\nAnd with his blistered thumb hits play\nAnd with the volume up he goes and fills his cup", "And lets the drummer's drum take away the pain, the pain\nBreaking, Forsaken...", "What's that you're taking?\nAaw, needing the feeling\nHe lets the records play\nShould the future dim\nA cigarette lights hymn", "Vaporized a green light grin\nAnd when the shot glass talks\nHe knows to listen up", "Until he's nice and numb again\nShakened, Awakened\nNot one for faking", "Kneeling, his healing\nHe lets the records play", "There's wisdom in his ways\nI been down and I fell so hard and far from grace", "I been hurt and I still recall the flaws on her face\nI been off, but I'm on, up above my feet, my feet again\n(Guitar Solo)\nShaken, Forsaken\nWhat's that your taking?\nAaw, needing the feeling\nHe lets the records play\nShakened, Awakened\nNot one for faking\nKneeling, his healing\nHe lets the records play\nOh, there's wisdom in his ways"]
