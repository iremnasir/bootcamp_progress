["I'm questioning my education\nIs my education all i am now?\nWhile you're deciding i've been finding\nLooking around in the here and now", "If I'd been taught from the beginning\nWould my fears now be winning?", "I'm questioning my own equation\nIs my own equation relevant somehow\nThe flags will wave and the news is breaking\nSee the man who came, forgot his own tie", "If I'd been taught from the beginning\nWould my fears now be winning?\nA wild world, figured out the answers\nI'll be in my own, dancing out, ou-out yeaaah", "I'm questioning my education\nRewinding, what does it show?\nCould be, the truth, it becomes you\nI'm a seed wondering why i'm grown."]
