["There's a girl on a ledge she's got nowhere to turn\n'Cause all the love that she had was just wood that she burned\nNow her life is on fire, it's no one's concern\nShe can blame the world or pray till dawn", "But only love can break her fall\nBreak her fall\nYeah, only love can break her fall, fall", "It's like she lost her invitation to the party on earth\nAnd she's standing outside hating everyone here\nYeah, she's her own disease, crying to her doll", "But only love can break her fall\nBreak her fall\nOnly love can break her fall, yeah", "Yeah fall\nThe world is her fall, break her fall\nLove, love, love can break her fall\nNow only love can break her fall\nLove, love, can break her fall, fall\nLove, love can break her fall\nOnly love can break her"]
