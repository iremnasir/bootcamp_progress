["All my rivals will see what I have in store\nMy gun\nI've been harboring fleets in this reservoir\nRed sun\nAnd this nation's about to explode", "Your disciples are riddled with metaphors\nWell hung\nBetter pony up and bring both your barrels full\nNot one\nAs we release this unspeakable toll, wooh", "How's our mother to damn these contributors?\nWith mud\nHow will the man who made chemicals difficult\nShed blood?\nHow's our father supposed to be told?\nI don't, oh"]
