["Sheets of empty canvas\nUntouched sheets of clay\nWere laid spread out before me\nAs her body once did", "All five horizons\nRevolved around her soul\nAs the Earth reaches the Sun\nNow, the air I tasted and breathed\nHas taken a turn", "Ooh, and all I taught her was everything\nOoh, I know she gave me all that she wore\nAnd now my bitter hands\nChafe beneath the clouds\nOf what was everything\nAll the pictures have\nAll been washed in black\nTattooed everything", "I take a walk outside\nI'm surrounded by some kids at play\nI can feel their laughter\nSo why do I sear?", "Mm, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head\nI'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning\nHow quick the Sun can drop away\nAnd now my bitter hands\nCradle broken glass\nOf what was everything\nAll the pictures have\nAll been washed in black\nTattooed everything\nAll the love gone bad\nTurned my world to black\nTattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be, yeah", "Uh-huh\nUh-huh\nWoo\nI know that someday you'll have a beautiful life\nI know you'll be a star\nIn somebody else's sky\nBut why, why, why can't it be\nWhy can't it be mine?\nAh, yeah\nUh, woo-hoo"]
