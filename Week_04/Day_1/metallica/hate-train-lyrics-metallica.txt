["Hate is a train\nThat thunders aimless through my head\nAnd hate is the fame\nChained to the wheel until I'm dead", "Rage is a flame\nCreates a touch to boil the seas\nAnd rage is to blame\nForever sorry I shall be", "And from a darkness I descend\nClenching a torch of sweet revenge", "You took away tomorrow, still I stand\nI ride into the sorrow, still I stand\nYou took away tomorrow, still I stand\nStraight down into the sorrow but still I stand", "Wrath is the name\nBranding suffer onto you\nAnd wrath takes the shame\nAnd holds me down until it's through", "And from a darkness I descend\nClenching a torch of sweet revenge", "You took away tomorrow, still I stand\nI ride into the sorrow, still I stand\nYou took away tomorrow, still I stand\nI sink into the sorrow but still I stand", "And hate is a train\nA beast awakened by your call\nAnd hate is a train\nA beast that never slows at all", "And from a darkness I descend\nClenching a torch of sweet revenge\nBurst into flame, the bitter end\nAnd shake the gates of hell again", "I'm cursed to drown in sorrow", "You took away tomorrow, still I stand\nI ride into the sorrow, still I stand\nYou took away tomorrow, still I stand\nYou left me here with sorrow, still I stand"]
