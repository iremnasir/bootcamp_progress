["I see that nothin's changed\nInsist on playing games\nSome waste of time you are\nAnd you're so popular\nWell this is it you bitch\nI've got to make my switch\nI'm just another john\nI know what's goin' on", "Your move\nWhat do I have to lose?\nStalemate\nNo! Too late, too late", "I thought you was for real\nBut you're a rip-off deal\nDon't give me all that crap\nI just escaped your trap\nI think you see the joke\nBut you're just chasin' smoke\nYou ain't another one\nI know what's goin' on", "Your move\nWhat do I have to lose?\nStalemate\nHello, too late, too late\nOh!", "Get on it!", "Misunderstanding me\nThe way you feel so free\nI'm gonna jump the gun\nOh I'm gonna hit an' run\nYour credibility\nDon't cut no ice with me\nAnother privilege gone\nI know what's goin' on", "Your move\nWhat do I have to lose?\nStalemate\nOh oh, too late, too late\nOh, too late, too late"]
