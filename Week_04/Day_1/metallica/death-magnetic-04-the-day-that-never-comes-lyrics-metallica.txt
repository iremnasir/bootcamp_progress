["Born to push you around\nBetter just stay down\nYou pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground", "Mouth so full of lies\nTend to black your eyes\nJust keep them close, keep praying, just keep waiting", "Waiting for the one\nThe day that never comes\nWhen you stand up and feel the warmth\nBut the sunshine never comes, no\nNo, the sunshine never comes", "Push you across that line\nJust stay down this time\nHide in yourself, crawl in yourself, youll have your time", "God Ill make them pay\nTake it back one day\nIll end this day, Ill splatter color on this gray", "Waiting for the one\nThe day that never comes\nWhen you stand up and feel the warmth\nBut the sunshine never comes", "Love is a four letter word\nand never spoken here\nLove is a four letter word\nHere in this prison\nI suffer this no longer\nI put it into\nThis I swear, this I swear, the sun will shine\nThis I swear, this I swear, this I swear"]
