["And the road becomes my bride\nAnd the road becomes my bride\nI have stripped of all but pride, so in her I do confide\nAnd she keeps me satisfied, gives me all I need\nAnd with dust in throat I crave", "Only knowledge will I save, to the game you stay a slave\nRover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond\nCall me what you will", "But I'll take my time anywhere\nFree to speak my mind anywhere\nAnd I'll redefine anywhere", "Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home\nAnd the earth becomes my throne\nAnd the earth becomes my throne", "I adapt to the unknown, under wandering stars I've grown\nBy myself but not alone, I ask no one", "And my ties are severed clean\nThe less I have the more I gain, off the beaten path I reign\nRover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond\nCall me what you will, But I'll take my time anywhere", "I'm free to speak my mind anywhere\nAnd I'll never mind anywhere\nAnywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home", "But I'll take my time anywhere\nI'm free to speak my mind\nAnd I'll take my time anywhere", "Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home\nBut I'll take my time anywhere\nI'm free to speak my mind anywhere", "And I'll redefine anywhere\nAnywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home", "Carved upon my stone\nMy body lie but still I roam\nWherever I may roam\nWherever I may roam\nWherever I may roam\nWherever I may roam\nWherever I may wander, wander, wander\nWherever I may roam\nWherever I may roam\nWherever I may roam"]
