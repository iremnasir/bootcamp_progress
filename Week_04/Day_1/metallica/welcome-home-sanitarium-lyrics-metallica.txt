["Welcome to where time stands still\nNo one leaves and no one will\nMoon is full, never seems to change\nJust labeled mentally deranged", "Dream the same thing every night\nI see our freedom in my sight\nNo locked doors, no windows barred\nNo things to make my brain seem scarred", "Sleep my friend and you will see\nThe dream is my reality\nThey keep me locked up in this cage\nCan't they see it's why my brain says rage", "Sanitarium, leave me be\nSanitarium, just leave me alone", "Build my fear of what's out there\nCan I breathe the open air\nWhisper things into my brain\nAssuring me that I'm insane", "They think our heads are in their hands\nBut violent use brings violent plans\nKeep him tied, it makes him well\nHe's getting better, can't you tell?", "No more can they keep us in\nListen, damn it, we will win\nThey see it right, they see it well\nBut they think this saves us from our hell", "Sanitarium, leave me be\nSanitarium, just leave me alone\nSanitarium, (just leave me alone)\nFear of living on, natives getting restless now\nMutiny in the air, got some death to do\nMirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word\nSeems the only way for reaching out again"]
