["Motives changing\nDay to day\nThe fire increases\nMasks decay\nI look at the river\nWhite foam floats down\nThe body's poisoned\nGot to sit tight", "The wait\nThe wait\nThe wait\nThe wait", "After awakening\nThe silence grows\nThe screams subside\nDistortion shows\nMutant thoughts\nOf bad mouthed news\nIt's just another birth\nOf distorted views", "The wait\nThe wait\nThe wait\nThe wait", "The wait\nThe wait\nThe wait\nThe wait"]
