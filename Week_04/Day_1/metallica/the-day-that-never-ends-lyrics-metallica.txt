["Born to push you around,\nBetter just stay down,", "You put away,\nHe hits the flesh,\nYou hit the ground,\nMouth so full of lies,\nTend to black your eyes,", "Just keep them closed,\nKeep praying just keep waiting,", "Waiting for the one,\nThe day that never comes,\nWhen you stand up and feel the warmth,\nBut the sunshine never comes,", "No the sunshine never comes", "Pushed you across that line,\nJust stay down this time,", "Hide in yourself,\nCrawl in yourself,\nYou'll have your time,", "God I'll make them pay,\nTake you back one day,\nI'll end this day,\nI'll splatter color on this gray,", "Waiting for the one,\nThe day that never comes,\nWhen you stand up and feel the warmth,\nBut the sunshine never comes,", "Love is a fallen word,\nAnd never spoken here,\nLove is a fallen word,\nHere in this prison,", "I suffer this no longer,\nI'll put an end to,\nThis I swear, This I swear,", "The sun will shine,\nThis I swear, This I swear,\nThis I swear"]
