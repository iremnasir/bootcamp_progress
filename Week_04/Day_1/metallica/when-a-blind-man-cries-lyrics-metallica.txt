["If you're leaving, close the door\nI'm not expecting people, anymore\nHear me grieving, lying on the floor\nWhether drunk or dead, I really ain't too sure", "I'm a blind man\nI'm a blind man\nAnd my world is pale\nWhen a blind man cries\nLord, you know\nThere ain't a sadder tale", "Had a friend once, in a room\nHad a good time, but it ended much too soon\nIn a cold month, in that room\nWe found a reason, for the things we had to do", "I'm a blind man\nI'm a blind man\nNow my room is cold\nWhen a blind man cries\nLord, you know\nHe feels it from his soul", "I'm a blind man\nI'm a blind man\nAnd my world is pale\nWhen a blind man cries\nLord, you know\nThere ain't a sadder tale"]
