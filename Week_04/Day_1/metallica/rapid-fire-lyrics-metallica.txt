["Pounding the world like a battering ram\nForging the furnace for the final grand slam\nChopping away at the source soon the course will be done\nLeaving a trail of destruction that's second to none\nHammering anvils straining muscle and might\nShattering blows crashing browbeating fright\nFast devastating and desolisating the curse\nBlasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth Wielding the axe comes the one culmination\nThat's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed\nSifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage\nOf the dogs which must fall to the just and be free\nNow grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled\nTill this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war\nThe slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay\nPounding the world like a battering ram\nForging the furnace for the final grand slam\nChopping away at the source soon the course will be done\nLeaving a trail of destruction that's second to none\nSecond to none"]
