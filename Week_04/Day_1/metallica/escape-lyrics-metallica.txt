["Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy\nI know I'm my best friend\nNo one cares, but I'm so much stronger\nI'll fight until the end\nTo escape from the true false world\nUndamaged destiny\nCan't get caught in the endless circle\nRing of stupidity", "Out for my own, out to be free\nOne with my mind, they just can't see\nNo need to hear things that they say\nLife is for my own to live my own way", "Rape my mind and destroy my feelings\nDon't tell me what to do\nI don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side\nAnd I can see through you\nFeed my brain with your so called standards\nWho says that I ain't right\nBreak away from your common fashion\nSee through your blurry sight", "Out for my own, out to be free\nOne with my mind, they just can't see\nNo need to hear things that they say\nLife is for my own to live my own way\nSee them try to bring the hammer down\nNo damn chains can hold me to the ground\nLife is for my own to live my own way"]
