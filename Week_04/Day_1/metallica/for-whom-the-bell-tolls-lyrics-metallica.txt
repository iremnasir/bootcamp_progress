["Make his fight on the hill in the early day\nConstant chill deep inside\nShouting gun, on they run through the endless grey\nOn they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?\nFor a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know\nStiffened wounds test their pride\nMen on five, still alive through the raging glow\nGone insane from the pain that they surely know", "For whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on", "For whom the bell tolls", "Take a look to the sky just before you die\nIt is the last time you will\nBlackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky\nShattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry\nStranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery\nHe hears the silence so loud\nCrack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be\nNow they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see\nFor whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on\nFor whom the bell tolls"]
