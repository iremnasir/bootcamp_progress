["Life, it seems, will fade away\nDrifting further, every day\nGetting lost within myself\nNothing matters, no one else\nI have lost the will to live\nSimply nothing more to give\nThere is nothing more for me\nNeed the end to set me free", "Things not what they used to be\nMissing one inside of me\nDeathly loss, this can't be real\nI cannot stand this hell I feel\nEmptiness is filling me\nTo the point of agony\nGrowing darkness, taking dawn\nI was me, but now he's gone", "No one but me\nCan save myself\nBut it's too late\nNow I can't think\nThink why I should even try", "Yesterday seems as though\nIt never existed\nDeath greets me warm\nNow I will just say goodbye\nBye..."]
