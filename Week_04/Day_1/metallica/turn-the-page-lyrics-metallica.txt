["On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha\nYou can listen to the engines\nmoanin' Out its one note song\nYou can think about the woman or the girl\nYou knew the night before", "But your thoughts will soon be wandering\nThe way they always do\nWhen you're ridin' sixteen hours\nAnd there's nothin' much to do\nAnd you don't feel much like riding\nYou just wish the trip was through", "Here I am, On the road again\nThere I am, Up on the stage\nThere I go, Playin' star again\nThere I go, Turn The Page", "So you walk into this restaurant\nStrung out from the road\nAnd you feel the eyes upon you\nAs you're shaking off the cold\nYou pretend it doesn't bother you\nBut you just want to explode", "Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk\nBut other times you can\nAll the same old clich\u00c3\u00a9s:\n\"Is it woman? Is it man?\"\nAnd you always seem outnumbered\nYou don't dare make a stand\nMake your stand", "Here I am, On the road again\nThere I am, Up on the stage\nHere I go, Playn' star again\nThere I go, Turn The Page", "Whoa-oh\nOut there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away\nEvery ounce of energy, you try and give away\nAs the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play\nLater in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed\nWith the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head\nYou smoke the day's last cigarette\nRememberin' what she said\nWhat she said\n(Yeah, what she said.)\nYeah", "Here I am, on the road again\nThere I am, up on the stage\nHere I go, playn' star again\nThere I go, Turn The Page\nAnd there I go, turn that page\nThere I go, yeah\nThere I go, there I go\n(And I'm gone)"]
