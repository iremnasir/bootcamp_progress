["No more!\nThe crap rolls out your mouth again\nHaven't changed, your brain is still gelatine\nLittle whispers circle around your head\nWhy don't you worry about yourself instead", "Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?\nGossip is burning on the tip of your tongue\nYou lie so much you believe yourself\nJudge not lest ye be judged yourself", "Holier than thou\nYou are\nHolier than thou\nYou are\nYou know not", "Before you judge me take a look at you\nCan't you find something better to do\nPoint the finger, slow to understand\nArrogance and ignorance go hand in hand", "It's not who you are, it's who you know\nOthers lives are the basis of your own\nBurn your bridges and built them back with wealth\nJudge not lest ye be judged yourself", "Holier than thou\nYou are\nHolier than thou\nYou are\nYou know not", "(yeah! who the hell are you?)\nHolier than thou\nYou are\nHolier than thou\nYou are\nYou know not\nNot!"]
