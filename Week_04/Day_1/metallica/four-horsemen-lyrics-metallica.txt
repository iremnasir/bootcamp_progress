["By the last breath of the fourth winds blow\nBetter raise your ears\nThe sound of hooves knocks at your door\nLock up your wife and children now\nIt's time to wield the blade\nFor now you have got some company\nThe Horsemen are drawing nearer\nOn the leather steeds they ride\nThey have come to take your life\nOn through the dead of night\nWith the four Horsemen ride\nor choose your fate and die\nYou have been dying since the day\nYou were born\nYou know it has all been planned\nThe quartet of deliverance rides\nA sinner once a sinner twice\nNo need for confession now\nCause now you have got the fight of your life\nThe Horsemen are drawing nearer\nOn the leather steeds they ride\nThey have come to take your life\nOn through the dead of night\nWith the four Horsemen ride\nor choose your fate and die\nTime\nHas taken its toll on you\nThe lines that crack your face\nFamine\nYour body it has torn through\nWithered in every place\nPestilence\nFor what you have had to endure\nAnd what you have put others through\nDeath\nDeliverance for you for sure\nThere is nothing you can do\nSo gather round young warriors now\nand saddle up your steeds\nKilling scores with demon swords\nNow is the death of doers of wrong\nSwing the judgment hammer down\nSafely inside armor blood guts and sweat\nThe Horsemen are drawing nearer\nOn the leather steeds they ride\nThey have come to take your life\nOn through the dead of night\nWith the four Horsemen ride\nor choose your fate and die"]
