["Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail\nOnce you provoke her, rattling of her tail\nNever begins it, never, but once engaged\nNever surrenders, showing the fangs of rage\nDon't tread on me", "So be it\nThreaten no more\nTo secure peace is to prepare for war\nSo be it\nSettle the score\nTouch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore\nDon't tread on me", "Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite\nQuick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike\nShining with brightness, always on surveillance\nThe eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance\nDon't tread on me", "So be it\nThreaten no more\nTo secure peace is to prepare for war\nSo be it\nSettle the score\nTouch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore", "Don't tread on me\nSo be it\nThreaten no more\nTo secure peace is to prepare for war\nLiberty or death, what we so proudly hail\nOnce you provoke her, rattling on her tail", "So be it\nThreaten no more\nTo secure peace is to prepare for war\nSo be it\nSettle the score\nTouch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore\nDon't tread on me"]
