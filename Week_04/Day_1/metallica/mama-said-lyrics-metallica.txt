["Mama she has taught me well\nTold me when i was young\n\"son your life's an open book\nDon't close it 'fore its done\"\n\"the brightest flame burns quickest\"\nThat's what i heard her say\nA son's heart sowed to mother\nBut i must find my way\nLet my heart go\nLet your son grow\nMama let my heart go\nLet this heart be still\nYeah still\nRebel mind your last name\nWild blood in my veins\nThey bring strings around my neck\nThe mark that still remains\nLeft home at an early age\nOf what i heard was wrong\nI never asked forgiveness\nBut what is said is done\nLet my heart go\nLet your son grow\nMama, let my heart go\nLet this heart be still\nNever i ask of you\nBut never i gave\nBut you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave\nNever i ask of you\nBut never i gave\nBut you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave\nSo let this heart be still\nMama, now i'm coming home\nI'm not all you wished of me\nA mother's love for her son\nSpoken, help me be\nI took your love for granted\nNot a thing you said to me\nI needed your arms to welcome me\nBut, a cold stone's all i see\nLet my heart go\nLet your son grow\nMama, let my heart go\nLet this heart be still\nLet my heart go\nMama, let my heart go\nYou never let my heart go\nSo let this heart be still\nNever i ask of you\nBut never i gave\nBut you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave\nNever i ask of you\nBut never i gave\nBut you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave\nLet this heart be still"]
