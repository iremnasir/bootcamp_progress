["Make his fight on the hills in the early day\nConstant chill deep inside\nShouting gun on they run through the endless gray\nOn they fight for their right, yes, but who's to say?", "For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know? wounds test their pride\nMen of five, still alive through the raging glow\nGone insane from the pain and they surely know", "For whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on\nFor whom the bell tolls", "Take a look to the sky just before you die\nIt is the last time he will\nBlackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky\nShattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry", "Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery\nHe hears the silence so loud\nCrack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be\nNow they see what will be blinded eyes to see", "For whom the bell tolls\nTime marches on\nFor whom the bell tolls"]
