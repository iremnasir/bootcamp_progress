["Down in the depths of my fiery home\nThe summons bell will chime\nTempting you and all the earth\nto join our sinful kind\nThere is a job to be done and I'm the one\nYou people make me do it\nNow it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate\nto pull you down into this pit", "So come on\nJump in the Fire\nSo come on\nJump in the Fire", "With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins\nThe end is closing in\nFeeding on the minds of man\nand from their souls within\nMy disciples all shout to search you out\nAnd they always shall obey\nFollow me now my child not the meek or the mild\nBut do just as I say", "So come on\nJump in the Fire\nSo come on\nJump in the Fire", "Jump by your will or be taken by force\nI'll get you either way\nTrying to keep the hellfire lit\nI am stalking you as prey\nLiving your life as me I am you you see\nThere is part of me in everyone\nSo reach down grab my hand walk with me through\nthe land\nCome home where you belong\nSo come on\nJump in the Fire\nSo come on\nJump in the Fire"]
