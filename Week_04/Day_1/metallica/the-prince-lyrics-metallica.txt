["Now I see his face, I see his smile\nSuch a lonely place, no golden mile\nEyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart\nHis deeds through ages past tell of his part", "See his face, see his smile\nTime to die", "Angel from below, change my dreams\nI want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem\nI wish to sell my soul, to be reborn\nI wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns", "See his face, see his smile\nTime to die", "I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way\nDevil take my soul, with diamonds you repay\nI don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry\nAnd I will burn in hell, from the day I die", "See his face, see his smile\nTime to die"]
