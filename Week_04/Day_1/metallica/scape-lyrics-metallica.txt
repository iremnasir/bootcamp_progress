["Fell no pain, but my life ain't easy\ni know i'm my best friend\nno one cares, but i'm so much stronger\ni'll fight until the end\nto escape from the true false world\nundamaged destiny\ncan't get caught in the endless circle\nring of stupidity\nOut of my own, out to be free\none with my mind, they just can't see\nno need to hear things that they say\nlife is for my own to live my own way\nRape my mind and destroy my feelings\ndon't tell my what to do\ni don't care now, 'cause i'm on my side\nand i can see through you\nfeed my brain with your so called standards\nwho says that i ain't right\nbreak away from your common fashion\nsee through your blurry sight\nOut of my own, out to be free\none with my mind, they just can't see\nno need to hear things that they say\nlife is for my own to live my own way\nSee they try to bring the hammer down\nno damn chains can hold me to the ground\nlife is for my own to live my own way"]
