["Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind\npeople think I'm insane because I am Frowning all the time", "All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy\nThink I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify", "Can you help me?\nOccupy my brain?\noh yeah", "I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find\nI can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind", "Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry\nHappiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal", "And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state\nI tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late"]
