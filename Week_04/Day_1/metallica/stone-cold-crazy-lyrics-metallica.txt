["Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,\nI was dreaming I was Al Capone.\nRumours going round, gotta clear out of town,\nSmell like a dry fishbone.\nHere come the law, gonna break down the door,\nCarry me away once more.\nNever, never, never want it anymore,\nGotta get away from this stone cold floor.", "Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.\nRainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,", "And she's playing on my slide trombone.\nAnymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,\nGotta get away from this stone cold floor.\nCrazy, stone cold crazy, you know.", "Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,\nFully loaded Tommy gun.", "Here come the deputy\ntry fucking getting me\nGotta fucking get up and run\nThey got the sirens loose\nI ran right out of juice\nThey're gonna put me in a cell,\nIf I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.\nCrazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah"]
