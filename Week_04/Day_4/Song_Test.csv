645,we believe   , I believe there s no evil out there we didn t have a hand in You believe it s a time for peace and a time for understanding Some of us believe that we are chosen And if God is on our side we ll win the game And some of us believe that there s a heaven When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name But let s get it straight I believe there s just once chance in this world to hear our brothers You believe there s a better way to listen to each other We don t get what the other guy is saying We hear the words but we don t understand So around the world the same old anger raging And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down We believe there s a better way to fight There s a way to make our children safe at night We believe there s a war we could be winning But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill A man or a woman who knows how to say I m sorry With courage in his heart to match his creed A leader who can build a brand new morning And match the tide of changes Match the intent with the deed We believe there s a deed of obligation To bring reconciliation To make peace with every nation in our time We believe there s not a minute we should be wasting When the darkness falls it s too late to fix the crime It s peace that we need Every father every mother knows the meaning Human treasure that our leaders do forget And the bullets fly in the face of common reason And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get We believe there s a song that s worth the singing It s a song of truth we re bringing There s a way to share the Earth with everyone We believe every creature has a being Has a right to respect and feeling To live and breathe and flourish in the sun That s what we believe ,queen,2
