# SPICED Academy Data Science Program Projects

## Week 01: Gapminder Project

* For this week, we have examined Gapminder project's data and visualized the
correlation between each country's population and fertiliy rate. My GIF can be
found here:
  * [Population vs. Fertility](https://github.com/iremnasir/bootcamp_progress/blob/master/Week_01/Day_4/Pop_vs_fert.gif)
  * [Life Expectancy vs. Fertility](https://github.com/iremnasir/bootcamp_progress/blob/master/Week_01/Day_4/life_expectancy_vs_fert.gif)

* The project presentation as a Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/iremnasir/bootcamp_progress/blob/master/Week_01/Day_4/Project_Work-Wandering.ipynb) for the first GIF as an example.

* After the bootcamp, I chose this project as my pet project to advance further my Bokeh skills. It is about visualization of **child mortality rate correlation with population and income (as size of blobs) for all countries, **. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/iremnasir/bootcamp_progress/blob/master/Week_01/income_child_mortality/Child_Mortality_Income_Population_Bokeh.ipynb)
